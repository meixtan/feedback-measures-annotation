For example, someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was one element or part."," Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong.",use,340,343,used,1712204845302,"[""used""]"

I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again.

Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong.",for her @CAPS3 leaving,3184,3206,that her @CAPS3 left.,1712517047235,"[""that her @CAPS3 left.""]"

I don't think it is a good idea to change the grade point average that is required to participate in sports.

Some of the players would get kicked off the team because they just have a C and that could effect the whole team.

It could also effect your school because maybe the players are just so stressed from having to try to get a B instead of just a C.

A C is still a good grade.

A C is still passing and it shows that the person may not understand but he still try's.

When I get a C its because I tried but i don't quite understand the information.

He would try but on certain things he felt like it was just way to hard.

For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. Do you agree or disagree with this decision? Use specific details and examples to convince others to support your position. ","Do you agree or disagree with everyone doing extracurricular activities after school? Well I agree with everyone doing extracurricular activities. The reason I agree with this statement is because doing extracurricular activities can help people make friends and become more social,it helps them become more active and improves their physical ability and it improves their ability to work with other people.

Doing extracurricular activities can help people make friends by working together. It helps them become more social,for instance by joining football or other programs they meet other people with the same interests and they can connect in and out of school. They also meet a lot of faces they haven't met before during school and if they're in the same program or club they can get know each other more. They can connect with people of different ages when they're in the program so they can learn something from someone older than them or teach something to the younger person to help them to the right path in life.

It also helps their physical ability by doing drills and practicing everyday which will cause physical improvement to their body.

While it is important for a young adolescent to become involved in some form of an extracurricular, to make something of the such mandatory is unneeded and inconvenient for many. Taking part in a extra activities requires many resources which some people can't afford or simply don't have. For a student to become apart of something, it should be at their own free will and not because someone of higher status makes it not optional. With forcing these students into all of these different subjects and areas it can create issues with money for low income families, time consumption, student transportation, and student's overall mental health and happiness.

With families who struggled with income or have budgetary issues, this new rules could be extremely challenging. For those who are on the free or reduced lunch plan, it's even more likely that they wont be able to place their child into an extracurricular due to costs. Activities such as sports, dance, theater, and clubs cost money, something many don't have much of. Whether it's to simply enroll your child in the sport, to pay for dance shoes, or to buy supplies it always comes down to some sort of price. Even if a family is not struggling with funding, many see it as unnecessary to spend money on something their child truly doesn't wish to participate in.

It isn't uncommon for students who live in larger families with younger siblings to watch after the younger children. Many students who are apart of extracurricular often don't have this job nor need to be home earlier due to this reason. When students are forced to spend their free time at a practice or rehearsal, this creates conflict within the household dynamic. Without the children there to watch after their younger siblings or to perform everyday chores such as cleaning up after the house or tending to a farm if the student were to live in the more rural areas, it causes the family to have to search for daycare or hire an extra hand which is not only costly but also stressful.

Not only is it time that is an issue, but transportation is also a main concern. Many parents or legal guardians travel and work for several hours, often getting home late. If children are at extracurricular while their parents work, this means there is no one who is available to pick them up or provide transportation to such activity or back home. While carpooling or busing may be an option in specific areas, this does not apply to students who do not have access to said buses or who live in extremely rural areas, further from the school or activity site.

Joining an outside group or involving yourself in a social setting where one participates in a hobby may be healthy and is encouraged, but just because it is pushed for does not mean it should be mandatory. The decision to devote ones time, money, and effort to such a consuming thing should be a personal and willing choice. Forcing a student to become apart of the student counsel or to play a sport may seem like the healthy option and makes them involved in something, but sometimes this can be damaging to a student. If the child is unhappy with what they've been put into, and are forced to participate in this activity several times a week, it's bound to create some form of an issue with the student over time. It can cause depression or irritation, with one being forced into something that doesn't truly bring them joy which may both effect the students personal life and scholastic performance.

Becoming apart of an extracurricular activity should be a free willing, and personal choice that fits for both students and their families. This should revolve around the students wishes and not those of someone who does not know each child's personal situation. Forcing one into something they did not choose for themselves has very few positive effects and is bound to do more harm than good for each individual and their families. Enlisting each and every child into activities outside of school causes too many conflicts with time, money, transportation, and a student's overall well being. Although it's encouraged to participate in an extracurricular, it should not be made mandatory for students.",become apart of something,417,442,The phrase 'become apart of something' is a common error.

Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.
Write a letter to your principal convincing her which policy you believe is better. Support your position with specific reasons.","Dear Principal,

I believe that there are many reasons that both students should have phones in school and that they shouldn't. But really, the negatives to this issue outweigh the positives. So I think that your second policy of not allowing cell phones in school is the better choice.

First, cell phones are a major distraction to learning. Even if they aren't supposed to have them in class, many kids still will. Texting will happen in all the classes. Also, when kid's are caught with their phones in school, I don't believe the rule will be clear enough to get them in any real trouble like they most likely should have been.

A second problem to the idea of having cell phones in school is bullying and gossip. The problem has gotten so bad now in schools, that we learn about different types of it in class. It has definitely become a problem . So why add more fuel to that fire? Having cell phones during school would allow rumors and secrets to spread faster, bullies to find victims easier, and even the problem of bullying through technology would be greater. It's already a huge problem, it even has it's own name; Cyber bullying.

Cyber bullying is becoming a huge problem. It has sent many teenagers to suicide. Kids say things over technology they would never say in real life, face to face. Sometimes they do this because they know how mean what they're saying is. Adding to the amount of things that these kids already endure everyday after school through computers, phones, and other communicating devices, letting them have cell phones during school would just make it much worse. I honestly can't think of why anyone would want that to happen to those kids.

Looking from the side of those who think you should choose your first policy, they might say that it's best for the student's safety, in the case of an emergency or personal problem. Which is a good point, besides the fact that there are many phones in the school, most the teachers have cell phones of their own, and the office always has access to multiple phones. Even if every single phone is unavailable and all the teacher's cell phones have been gotten rid of somehow, it is very rare. So rare in fact, that I don't believe it to be an issue. Another thing they might say is that if kids are going to turn them off in class, there isn't a problem. Well, yes there is because most kids won't actually turn them off in class.

If you give them a chance, most of them are going to take it.

Having cell phones in locker rooms and bathrooms could lead to many horrible problems also. Things could be done with cell phones that could ruin someone's life forever. It's not good to even take that chance. I personally have seen something like that happen, and it does not end well for anyone.

My point is that cell phones in school might seem fine, until something bad happens. There may be a few positive things about it, but many negatives. I hope you take this into consideration.

Having cell phones in locker rooms and bathrooms could lead to many horrible problems also. Things could be done with cell phones that could ruin someone's life forever. It's not good to even take that chance. I personally have seen something like that happen, and it does not end well for anyone.

My point is that cell phones in school might seem fine, until something bad happens. There may be a few positive things about it, but many negatives. I hope you take this into consideration.

Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.
Write a letter to your principal convincing her which policy you believe is better. Support your position with specific reasons.","Dear Principal,

I believe that there are many reasons that both students should have phones in school and that they shouldn't. But really, the negatives to this issue outweigh the positives. So I think that your second policy of not allowing cell phones in school is the better choice.

First, cell phones are a major distraction to learning. Even if they aren't supposed to have them in class, many kids still will. Texting will happen in all the classes. Also, when kid's are caught with their phones in school, I don't believe the rule will be clear enough to get them in any real trouble like they most likely should have been.

A second problem to the idea of having cell phones in school is bullying and gossip. The problem has gotten so bad now in schools, that we learn about different types of it in class. It has definitely become a problem . So why add more fuel to that fire? Having cell phones during school would allow rumors and secrets to spread faster, bullies to find victims easier, and even the problem of bullying through technology would be greater. It's already a huge problem, it even has it's own name; Cyber bullying.

Cyber bullying is becoming a huge problem. It has sent many teenagers to suicide. Kids say things over technology they would never say in real life, face to face. Sometimes they do this because they know how mean what they're saying is. Adding to the amount of things that these kids already endure everyday after school through computers, phones, and other communicating devices, letting them have cell phones during school would just make it much worse. I honestly can't think of why anyone would want that to happen to those kids.

Looking from the side of those who think you should choose your first policy, they might say that it's best for the student's safety, in the case of an emergency or personal problem. Which is a good point, besides the fact that there are many phones in the school, most the teachers have cell phones of their own, and the office always has access to multiple phones. Even if every single phone is unavailable and all the teacher's cell phones have been gotten rid of somehow, it is very rare. So rare in fact, that I don't believe it to be an issue. Another thing they might say is that if kids are going to turn them off in class, there isn't a problem. Well, yes there is because most kids won't actually turn them off in class.
