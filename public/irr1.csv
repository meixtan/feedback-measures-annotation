Your principal is deciding whether to require all students to perform community service. 
Write a letter to your principal in which you take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service. Support your position with examples.","Dear Principal,

I understand that you are deciding whether or not to make community service a school requirement. This is a big decision for the school and its students and you must look at the perspective of some of the students.

I myself find community service appealing and would enjoy have it as a school requirement, but I believe making it a requirement for all students is not a smart idea. Some of the students have jobs they have to do after school and do not have the time to do community service. An example of one of the jobs that students may have is to watch their siblings after school while their parents are working.

I believe community service should be required by all students. So I think that students who already have too much food on their plate should have to bring in a parent or guardian to say in person that schoolwork, homework, and community work is too much for their child to handle. This way a smart student will not be given a bad grade because they did not fulfill the required community service.

This is what I believe and what I think should be done about required community service. Thank you for taking the time from your day to hear my words and I do hope that they have helped you decide on what to do in relation to community service.

I understand that you are deciding whether or not to make community service a school requirement. This is a big decision for the school and its students and you must look at the perspective of some of the students.

I myself find community service appealing and would enjoy have it as a school requirement, but I believe making it a requirement for all students is not a smart idea. Some of the students have jobs they have to do after school and do not have the time to do community service. An example of one of the jobs that students may have is to watch their siblings after school while their parents are working.

Use specific details and examples to convince others to support your position. ","""All students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.""why? well because it helps you a lot in the future or now so the principal is right on letting every student do an extracurricular activity.

To me each student actually should participate in one or more activity. Because it helps you mentally and emotionally,and helps you get collage credits and be healthy. Many research has proven many reason why people should do at least one activity to help you benefit in life .Research has proven people who have done sports most likely wont have heart attacks or won't even have breathing problems or mostly any issues.

How it helps you benefit in staying fit or healthy or both is well playing a sport can really help you lose weight .help you be more active like for example playing baseball,basketball,track or even being a cheerleader and many other sports can help you a lot more then you think, because research has proven a lot that people who are more active are people who are benefiting from it a lot .

Another way it helps you is emotionally is because you get distracted and you dont think about the stuff that is stressing you all the time. you know you have a break from what is keeping you stressed because you are having fun. for example of having a way to distract yourself isn't just sports its working with other like helping out the councilor, helping out in making the yearbook, helping around in the school and not being just about you when your just thinking all about you well that is the problem. Instead of have all the students separated you can put all of the students each in different groups everyday that way people get to know each other and have fun .

collage credits also matter and playing a sport or just helping around the school would look amazing on a collage application . Extra activities would make a lot more collages be interested in you and most likely be interested in giving you a scholarship. You mostly get into a great collage because all the extra credit actually helps you get noticed by a lot of collages because they aren't just looking for people who have good grades they are looking for people who actually are more outstanding.
