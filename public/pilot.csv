3129,2,hs,Persuasive,"""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any ofus."" --Katherine Paterson, Author 
Write a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your views on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading.","There are many books in the library that shouldn't be there. From books about racism, violence, or pornagraphy I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those type of books out of the library.     A library in a school is a great way to help sudents with projects, essays, or just to read. If my child was in elementry or even middle school , I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet. If my teenager was in high school though, I wouldn't mind that because they are old enough to realize the things that actually go on in the world. They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornagraphy, in which the library is better place to find a book then the interent that could take them to many bad websites. Since I go to my local high school I think its nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school. It makes it easier to work on projects.      Also in libraries there are a ton of music, movies, and magazines. If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there? If the music is rap, pop, or country they could just get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library providing it. Magazines can also be educational. If you are doing a project on fashion a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 would be excellent to help them find out some tips. Magazines can also have some inaproprate things in them. Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. Whenever I look in magazines I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, food, and people. Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers they understand. Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too. There are a ton of @CAPS4 around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library.     In conclusion I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library.

Many kids and parents thing that you should not allow students to have phones at school at all because of our grades. But to be honest I think you should pick Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

Use specific details and examples to convince others to support your position. ","The student council is holding a meeting at the cafeteria while the school basketball team is practicing for their upcoming game. These things are called extracurricular activities. The principle has decided these things are mandatory. I think students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because students schedules and students being forced to do something they dont want to do.

Lots of students have busy lives. Students and their parents could have something planned or reserved for a certain time.( going to parties, a get together, vacations/trips, shopping etc.) The activity and plan might collide, which probably would cause rescheduling and chaos. Students could also already have an activity outside of school. How I see it in my mind is that if someone already takes a sport (outside of school) and now has to take another activity in school. They would have less time, less motivation, and more work. Our four core classes and two electives already give us plenty of homework to do. Doing an activity will require more effort and less time to do the homework from our classes. Whether it be a writing assignment for the student council, doing work for the yearbook club or practicing for a sport.

Students may feel forced to do an activity they dont like. For some kids their might not be an activity they enjoy and then proceed to pick one they dont like. Doing this could make them resent school or feel some type of sadness. Their also could be a large demand for one activity a student has applied for. After applying the student learns hes been excluded because of maximum limit of people in one club. The student is now in a club he doesn't enjoy. If I was in the student shoes i would feel like the school has been unfair or betrayed me. Being forced to do something is almost never a good thing. especially if you don't enjoy it. Forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do could cause a state of depression, anxiety or a fear of it.

However, participating in extracurricular activities would mean less screen time. Students can socialize and plus most teenagers are addicted to their phones and its not healthy for them at all. Doing activities will decrease the time by a good percentage. Being addicted to anything is definitely not healthy but, being forced to do something isnt either. In my opinion more screen time is better than doing something you resent because you are enjoying it and you are also technically socializing by messaging or calls. All in all lots of screen time may not be healthy, but its better than participating in activity you dont like.

In my opinion more screen time is better than doing something you resent because you are enjoying it and you are also technically socializing by messaging or calls. All in all lots of screen time may not be healthy, but its better than participating in activity you dont like.

In conclusion it shouldn't be mandatory to be in an extracurricular activity because of the schedules of students and being forced to do something you dont want to do. Activities will interfere with these things causing chaos and even resenting school. This is my honest opinion on this decision. If you take the time to think about this decision, you'll realize whos going to be effected and how they are going to be effected.

The principle has decided these things are mandatory. I think students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because students schedules and students being forced to do something they dont want to do.

Lots of students have busy lives. Students and their parents could have something planned or reserved for a certain time.( going to parties, a get together, vacations/trips, shopping etc.) The activity and plan might collide, which probably would cause rescheduling and chaos. Students could also already have an activity outside of school. How I see it in my mind is that if someone already takes a sport (outside of school) and now has to take another activity in school. They would have less time, less motivation, and more work. Our four core classes and two electives already give us plenty of homework to do. Doing an activity will require more effort and less time to do the homework from our classes. Whether it be a writing assignment for the student council, doing work for the yearbook club or practicing for a sport.

Students may feel forced to do an activity they dont like. For some kids their might not be an activity they enjoy and then proceed to pick one they dont like. Doing this could make them resent school or feel some type of sadness. Their also could be a large demand for one activity a student has applied for. After applying the student learns hes been excluded because of maximum limit of people in one club. The student is now in a club he doesn't enjoy. If I was in the student shoes i would feel like the school has been unfair or betrayed me. Being forced to do something is almost never a good thing. especially if you don't enjoy it.

Use specific details and examples in your response.","Imagine yourself in a stressful situation causing you to be confused and frustrated because you cannot form a legitimate solution. In this situation your problem may be dire, but the usage of advice from others can help you. Through everyday life, we are constantly finding ourselves in troubling circumstances. Gaining advice from multiple sources is a powerful way to combat our problems. Often, it is advice and guidance from others that provides us with the strength and expertise needed to resolve conflict. Support from friends or family and assertive words can be just what we need when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple sources for advice can influence you to make better decisions because you learn different perspectives, gain knowledge from others who have dealt with similar circumstances, and realize the multiple ways to solve the problem.

It is helpful to seek advice from many sources because you can realize the many different perspectives of your situation. When seeking advice from others, we likely already have a favored position on the topic. Sometimes, we search for reassurance and not advice. However, questioning others about our situations is better for the outcome of the experience because it brings us new perspectives. Perspective can be key to finding the solution to a problem because it allows one to look at the problem as a whole, and not just from a biased position. When blinded by a biased perspective, we force ourselves to ignore different outlooks on the situation. It is when we remove that toxic blindfold that we realize whether we are truly in the wrong or what is the true source of the conflict. Having different perspectives will only provide you with a more sincere and graceful approach to dealing with a problem.

Questioning others about ways to resolve your problems is helpful because it provides you with input from people have dealt with similar circumstances. Specifically, it is more beneficial when you ask others who have dealt with similar experiences for help. When we do this, we find ourselves relating to others and taking their advice into greater consideration. Through this method, we gain knowledge on possible outcomes for our conflict and how it can be resolved. While filtering our own bias with this new information, we can formulate possible solutions for ourselves. This is an intriguing way that we can all solve our problems because we can use the experiences of others to better our own. Using the lessons learned by others to prevent yourself from carrying the same misfortunes is a key way to avoid conflict. This strategy allows yourself to feel more comfortable about handling the problem because you know someone who has dealt with the same thing. No matter how complex a problem can be, empathy from another who can relate will make the situation better.

Asking other sources for their opinion also gives you the ability to interpret the situation in many different ways. It is inevitable that the more people you ask, the more likely you are to hear different opinions and opposing responses. This is a natural occurrence considering that as humans, we all have unique experiences that effect how we look at situations. Through asking others for possible solutions, we can find one that correlates best with how we feel. Sometimes it takes getting a large collection of advice from different sources to piece together a comfortable solution. We can carve away bits and pieces from that block of advice to sculpt our resolution. When seeking advice, we can act as detectives to collect the different fragments of advice and piece it together to form a conclusion.

As a result of us collectively having different experiences in life, we get to provide one another with new thoughts and ideas through giving advice. The process of seeking multiple opinions can provide you with a guaranteed and better outcome for handling a pressing conflict. You can also recognize the many ways one can look at the situation. As well as, recognize the results from of others when they went through the same occurrence, and the multiple ways you can resolve the situation. Having a myopic mind can be a true curse, and taking advice from others prohibits yourself from making consequential mistakes because of being blinded by bias. Talking to others who have dealt with the similar problem allows you to feel more comfortable in your situation, and gain some peace in being to relate to another. Having others provide with different ways they would resolve the situation allows you to consider the many options and pick the best one for your situation. Friends, family, associates and the others in your life all have access to the information you need to make the best decision for yourself. When dealing with conflict, it would be most beneficial to use their knowledge to prevent your problems from troubling you intensely.       ","In this situation your problem may be dire, but the usage of advice from others can help you.",131,224,"Consider clarifying this sentence by rephrasing it.

Asking other sources for their opinion also gives you the ability to interpret the situation in many different ways. It is inevitable that the more people you ask, the more likely you are to hear different opinions and opposing responses. This is a natural occurrence considering that as humans, we all have unique experiences that effect how we look at situations. Through asking others for possible solutions, we can find one that correlates best with how we feel. Sometimes it takes getting a large collection of advice from different sources to piece together a comfortable solution. We can carve away bits and pieces from that block of advice to sculpt our resolution. When seeking advice, we can act as detectives to collect the different fragments of advice and piece it together to form a conclusion.

As well as, recognize the results from of others when they went through the same occurrence, and the multiple ways you can resolve the situation.

In this situation your problem may be dire, but the usage of advice from others can help you. Through everyday life, we are constantly finding ourselves in troubling circumstances. Gaining advice from multiple sources is a powerful way to combat our problems.

It is helpful to seek advice from many sources because you can realize the many different perspectives of your situation. When seeking advice from others, we likely already have a favored position on the topic. Sometimes, we search for reassurance and not advice. However, questioning others about our situations is better for the outcome of the experience because it brings us new perspectives. Perspective can be key to finding the solution to a problem because it allows one to look at the problem as a whole, and not just from a biased position. When blinded by a biased perspective, we force ourselves to ignore different outlooks on the situation. It is when we remove that toxic blindfold that we realize whether we are truly in the wrong or what is the true source of the conflict. Having different perspectives will only provide you with a more sincere and graceful approach to dealing with a problem.

Questioning others about ways to resolve your problems is helpful because it provides you with input from people have dealt with similar circumstances. Specifically, it is more beneficial when you ask others who have dealt with similar experiences for help.

Through this method, we gain knowledge on possible outcomes for our conflict and how it can be resolved. While filtering our own bias with this new information, we can formulate possible solutions for ourselves. This is an intriguing way that we can all solve our problems because we can use the experiences of others to better our own. Using the lessons learned by others to prevent yourself from carrying the same misfortunes is a key way to avoid conflict.
