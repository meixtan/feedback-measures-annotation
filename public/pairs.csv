0," Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON1. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON1 is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me ""for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life."" That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS7 of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS1. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked. To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION1. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS3-@CAPS4, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS7 idea would be @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and purchased two high-tech @CAPS5 cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget.  When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself ""he @MONTH1 never get to do again."" We spent hours playing @CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and ""@CAPS6 it up"" together.  In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS7 friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH1 never know when those things can up and walk away.",14,4,hs,Narrative,"We all understand the benefits of laughter.

1," Hi my name is @CAPS1. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS2. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS2 made me the person I am but @CAPS2 has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1.  @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME1 air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON1 good @TIME1 and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME1. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS2 hurtful but to me @CAPS2 is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS2 just makes @CAPS2 worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON1 tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS2 cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS2 to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON1 will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS2 out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS2 can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH1 come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS2 has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS2 brought me back up again.",14,3,hs,Narrative,"We all understand the benefits of laughter.

2," Laughter is important in many ways. It can help you solve an argument with a friend, improve your health, and help in akward situations. All relationships need a little laughter to lighten the mood once in awhile. If we didn't have it, everything would be taken seriously all the time, and there would be many more feuds. One instence where laughter has helped, was when my best friend, @PERSON1, and I were in a big fight about someone spilling paint on a pair of shorts she owned. We were both accusing one another, and the more that happened, the worse the fight became overall. I remember right in the middle of the fight, @PERSON1 made a face that for some reason made me laugh. Once I laughed I could tell she wasn't amused. She began questioning why I was laughing. So I explained to her why I had been laughing, and she ran to the bathroom and looking into the mirror, made the same face that I had been laughing over. To my surprise, she started laughing as well. After the ten-minute laughing fit, I made a joke about the paint on her shorts, and we decided to splatter them with paint for a rather ""unique"" look. Needless to say, laughing saved us from getting into an even bigger argument. When people are angry or upset, physically they probably don't feel that good. They @MONTH1 feel angry for days, which in turn can give them physical pain. I know for me if I'm angry long enough I'll succumb to a headache and ironically, I get more angry at people around me because my head hurts and they're making it worse. Laughing is a way of @CAPS1 things go. Not necessarily being carefree, but learning to let go and live. Physical health is greatly affected by laughter. As well as mental health. Everyone needs to laugh to stay sane. Learning to not sweat the small stuff is really important.

You have more energy, but that's usually from the endorphines kicking in when you have a crazy fit of laughter. But also it lightens the mood tons when you're with other people. All people need to laugh. Married couples, students, teachers, and best friends. Laughing can bring people together. In the end, laughing can benefit you in many ways.

3,""" An enormous head nealy two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras fro a regioan of the Red Planet called Cydonia."" Although scientists might think the face-like civilization was created by aliens, but that is not the case. The Face is just a natural landform because landforms like this are common around Cydonia , and also because NASA unveiled an image stating that it was a rock formation giving the illusion of a face.

4,"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" introduces the idea that driverless cars are almost ready. My argument of driverless cars is, are they ready? Who is to blame if an accident happens? The manufacturer or the owner? Which the narrator also asks, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" The premise of my argument, is that the driver, should in no way be the one at fault. Unless they themselves wreck the car.

Driverless cars are a very unique sort of car. For one, they do not need a driver. In most cases, that is. Driverless cars have one factor that many car companies are working on: they also need a driver. Which makes them half driverless and half driver... full? BMW driverless cars can only go to about 25 mph (miles per hour), ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph,""

before needing assitance by the driver behind a wheel. GM has driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, ""...driver's seats that vibrate..."" Also, the Google car just says whenever the person is required to take over. ""...simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.""

What if a special needs/ disabled person uses one of these cars? Are the manufacturers going to blame them for not being able to use their own hands and feet on the vehicle? This is another scary thing that could very well happen in the future. At least a person without some kind of disability would have control of the car if the autopilot did indeed fail. My counter-argument to my argument would be that there are plenty of sensors around the car stated in paragraph 4, ""...they needed a whole lot of sensors,"" but, what if the senors failed? What if every single sensor failed and someone was incapable of controlling the car? Who is responsible?

My argument is not one that can be answered right now. It is just a question that many could use an answer from. The well-being and capability of the car is an important aspect of said car. Many bad accidents could happen and whether or not the accident is pinned on the car maker or the car driver is to be disputed.",6Nnd2npg2BwOId1tk1Z9,GPT4o,hs,Literary,"In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

6,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" article infroms the readers about Venus's harsh conditions and mankinds's curiosity to explore this unknown.

This curiosity has challenged The National Aeronaautics and Space Administration (NASA) to strive for a better understanding of Venus.

The author of this article supports this statement well enough, but could have supported his work better.

Throughout the article, the author describes the dangers of Venus explaining why exploration is diffiicult.

In paragraph 3, the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" proving that Venus can not support human life or any of human technology.

The author describes the danger well, however, he/she does not address why Venus is a worth pursuit for discovery.

The author repeatedly uses the unknown aspect of Venus's physical attributes and humans' natural curiosity as the two main motives for exploration on this planet.

Paragraph 8 shows this by opening with, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author continuously uses those two factors as to why humans are so keen on pursuing this inhospitable planet.

There is a lack of evidence explaining why Venus is worthy of exploration but informed why we should be exploring Venus but the author describes the dangers of Venus very well.

To strengthen the author's suggestion, studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents, he/she should have included details on what the planet can offer humans or given more reasons as to why humans are so motivated to explore our sister planet.

Dear principal,

I hear that you are deciding whether or not to make community service required in our school. I don't think that you should do this and I have many reasons why.

My first reason is that doing community service is supposed to make you feel good and make you feel like your doing something really nice out of the goodness of your heart. However, by making students do community service you are going to take that feeling away. They will be forced to do it and will not feel accomplished. They will feel like its a chore. When they grow up and they aren't required to do community service anymore they probably won't. As where a student who is not forced to do community service will probably grow up not thinking of it as a chore. They probably have a better chance of doing community service when they grow up too.

My second reason is that when children are forced to do something they don't do it as well as they could've. They will act spoiled and will not even bother to help in the community service. They will treat it like a chore and not even care about what there doing or how there doing it. They will cause a problem and may hurt someone. You have to want it and if you don't than your not going to work hard for it.

My third and final reason as to why I think you shouldn't make us all do community service is simply because me and my fellow classmates need to figure this stuff out on our own. Just as you and your family did.

We need to learn that life isn't all about us. We need to learn that we can't be selfish, and we have to think of other less fortunate people who can't afford anything we have and that we have to help them. Or we have to clean up the town a little. You have to let us figure this out on our own. Just as everybody else did. It will help us in the end.

These are all of the reasons why I strongly believe that you should not require us to do community service. I thank you for taking the time to read this message and hope that you will make a good decision.

Sincerely,

A fellow student",GPT4o,luY8g5nAEgnojuFd3kdI,ms,Persuasive,"Some of your friends perform community service. For example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter.

Dear Mr. Principal,

I believe that students should not be required to do community service. It is their choice. If they want to, they should but you can not force them to do so. I also believe that you should only make students who have gotten in trouble or been bad to do community service as punishment if you want to. This will help the community and make them learn their lesson. For an illustration, if a girl or a guy gets into trouble instead of giving them detention, just make them help out the world by doing some community service. This explains that it will benefit you and your world. This also illustrates that this punishment is better because in detention, you do nothing and just keep quiet but with this, they actually do something which would make them very sore and make them never want to do it again. I believe that detention rate might go down because of this. Time is very valuable which is why community service should be a choice.

People who do community services for free I believe should feel happy with themselves and shouldn't care what other people thinks. For a demonstration, if you have done something good and you friend told that it was a waist of time, you shouldn't care what they think. This explains that if you don't care, they might stop since people will stop if you show no reaction. This also explains that people can feel happy with what they do no matter what. This is why people shouldn't care about how people judges them.

10,"98% of studies have shown that extracurricular activities help the brain think and work harder. This is very important for a childs physical and mental health. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can maintain their healthy, help them develop important skills, and bring on important oppertunites later on in life.

Extracurricular activities such as sports is very important for a persons health. Staying active keeps the heart pumping and the blood flowing. This will drastically prevent health problems in the future, which can include strokes, heart attacks, and more.

Being physicaly active on a daily will keep a person healthy and strong. This is especially good for teens since their bodies are still developing. Not only this, but being active keeps people in shape. This will bost self confidence and make people less insecure about their body. Staying active can help both physical and mental health

13,"A driveless car how cool would that be? I bileve we should have Driveless Cars in the future. I say this because the car is not that dangerous in my oppion. The Driveless cars wil keep you alert, lets you take control at important times, and also gives you signals when it is most important.

The car will not put you in any danger because it has the ability to keep you alert. It has sensors as said in the text ""special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" if a car was realy so dangerous it would not let you know to keep you're hands on the whell at all times. I beieve it does that so if anything goes wrong you can quickly drive the car if needed.

Further more the car signals you when you need to drive at important times. The car is able to do many things and will tell you to do the most important ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zines and around accidents."" The is making sure you are safe at all time and letting you drive when it is most needed.

Lastly these Driveless Cars are smart enough to signal you so that you are never in accident. The fast actions are great in many ways ""the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attetion whenever a problem occurs."" it also has ""developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehcile is in danger of backing into and object."" this driveless car "" announces when the drivers should be prepared to take over."" This car is completely safe enough to let you know wehenever something imopratnt is coming uup.

The Driveless Cars are not fully driveless you still have to take cointrol at most times. So the car is still letting you be safe and put you're life in you're own hands at times.",AkdbLObPSBIpejLkOB6I,GPT4o,hs,Literary,"In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

18,"After some thought, my principal has decided that all students must be involved in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or be in the student council. I disagree with his decision because students should be able to choose what to do with their time, and students could have other important affairs or activities in their personal life.

Students should be able to handle the responsibility of managing what they do after school, and in their own time. For example, if students were busy with homework or clubs, they would have almost no free time after school. Time put aside to relax or have fun is just as important as doing school work. Additionally, extracurricular activities are generally optional, so students should have the choice whether to participate or not. While encouraging involvement in extra activities is good, there are other ways to increase participation than forcing students to do so, like putting up fliers or increasing interest.

In addition to this, I believe students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity because they could have important affairs in their personal life. Having to take care of a younger sibling, for example, or working at a part-time job. Even a sick family member is a possible reason to turn down an extracurricular activity, among others. Everyone has different circumstances; hence, it would be inconsiderate and nearly prudish to decide that every student must participate in an extracurricular activity.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principal's decision that students are required to participate in an after-school activity as it would be unfair to the students.. If students do not want to participate, they should not be forced, and we should be able to choose what to do with our time. In addition to this, students could have other things to do in their personal time than that related to school. Therefore, I oppose the principal's decision. ",5qkhu2Xacg2OFr8Csu1n,GPT4o,ms,Persuasive,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

19,"Aliens may or may not be real, but if they were they could not make this. I know this is just a natural landform. Yes it is weird that this landform looks like a face i agree with that, but saying aliens made it is just crazy. Here are some reasons on how i know and can prove that aliens did not make this.

First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.

The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.

The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West."" Then to prove it even more it says this. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an islolated mesa about the SAME height as the face in mar."" So that just said that these ""faces"" are common around the American West and I'm pretty sure aliens are not on earth. So unless aliens came to earth made a face and then left without NASA seeing it would be impossible.

These are my 3 reasons on why i think it is impossible that aliens made it. It's just a natural form. I am not saying aliens are not real but i am saying that they did not make this face without us seeing it.",GPT4o,guqVfMoe9bxNJaMtQid7,ms,Literary,"You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

20,"Although some say schools should not offer classes online because when students are out of school someone else could be doing the work for them and they will not be learning anything, actually schools should offer classes online because most of the students who go to schools have to work and they drop out of school to work and taking classes online would help them be educated at the same time they're working.

Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school it's hard. They are falling asleep in class and they don't want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime.

Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and that's what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldn't happen.

In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they don't have to wake up early every morning.

In conclusion,schools should provide classes online because colleges,universities also provide them and most of the people who have taken them have been successful from their classes.

Schools should not offer distance learning classes because students get distracted by their brothers, by the TV and by the phone. They can not focus on what they have to do, even if they know there is a lot of work that they have to get done.

Schools should not offer distance learning classes because they do not learn as much as being in school, they can not do projects that help students to learn more about the class they are taking, also they do not interact with people as they do in school.

Lastly, everyone needs to enjoy nature! It is a beautiful sight that everyone needs to expirence. Being trapped inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do. The beauties of nature are amanding everybody but @NUM1 of people don't take the opportunity to enjoy it. Being outside and enjoying yourself is a big thing for your body to survive. You need to sook up the powerful rays of the sun and have a life changing look around nature. But @CAPS1 of this will happen if you stay on your computer @NUM2.

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects computers have onpeople. Persuade the readers to agree with you.",16,teacher-AI

secondly i dont think driverless cares are very safe driverless cars are not driverless yet they are more of an asistant for the driver. the driver can not pay attention and that could lead to acdidents.

finally driverles cars are technolgy and technology can always have glitches and i dont know about you but i would not like my life to depend on a machine that can have glitches if a driverless car were ever to harm a driver the driver could sue the comapny and that would be a loss for the companies so the companies would be taking a risk so in conclusion i dont think driverless cars should be something that peaple can go out and buy.",GPT4o,m4J0F1dlL5fDySsezOUE,hs,Literary,"In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

27,"Asking for more than one person for advice can help the outcome.

It is helpful to seek advice from others, because it could give you a different view or solution for your questions.

Their opinion could have been something you have never thought of before. For this reason you have many different things people think of, since not everybody thinks the same. Advice can be good or not so good, but having someone give you more than one answer can help you decide which is best for you.

A different outlook on things can benefit the choices you make. Asking advice can change the way you thought about your choice, and help you make a different one.

Sometimes you could be stuck on something and asking one person for advice may not be enough.

While making a decision you may have some second thoughts, asking more people could help you decipher which works for you to complete your task.

Even having a discussion with a group could help open up some new ideas.

Having different people have different takes on your opinion. Sharing these ideas helps us communicate better and understand things more than we thought.

Others opinions and thoughts of advice can be something to argue against, but it helps us understand the person better. listening to others can also make them feel good and heard, hearing them out of what they want to say. They even may have something you would want to use in the future.

Listening to others opinions and getting a different outlook may just help you in your everyday life with tasks.",GPT4o,rfQv3LPBikeoFIE1NyA3,ms,Persuasive,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

28,"Being able to attend classes online is a dream come true. Many students miss a huge amount of school days because of personal reasons, health, or sports. However, taking a online class would resolve those issues. Students would benefit from online education because there's no reason to miss school and to work in a better environment

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

To conclude, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. On the other hand, some students think online school isnt for visual learners but online class has many ways to educate visual learners.

Online class has video conferencing to help better understand. Online school is for every student.                         ",GPT4o,IsptgwivswMcKuXygstJ,hs,Persuasive,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

29,"Cennsorship in Libraries       To remove something a person dislikes off of a shelf, is assuming other peoples opinions don't count. It really has to depend on what the product is. Such as a book, magazine, music album, or a movie. Usually in any store i've walked into, there are certain departments for each product. In these seperate departments, the product is always catagorized. Not from what people like, but by genera or age differences. If a person was to linger away from their section in that department and go to another part, their taste in their product will seem too different to like.      A local library in a persons commuinty will have many books to read and to choose from. There are baby books, kids sections, teenage and adults sections as well. The teenage section is for me! Although I used to always be in the kids section not that long ago, those books should now be removed because I have no use for them or wouldn't be interested in picking another one up. Yet that is just me. However the generation under me will soon love them. Just because one person dislikes something, doesn't mean it should be thrown out for everyone else.     Music is a different story. Some people like country and some people like alternative. In libraries they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to, before they rent it out. When I listen to one album to see if I like it and find out that I don't, I simply put it back on the shelf and try another one. The librarian doesn't throw it away because of my opinion, because to someone else it would be the sweetest music to their ears.      Anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion.

Now that I am allowed to watch whatever my heart desires, i've noticed that movies are based on maturity levels. In libraries, some movies arn't allowed to be rented by a younger person. Yet it doesn't mean they should be tossed out. When they are older they might actually like them.     Overall a persons opinion will be the most important one to them. Other opinions wont matter.

29,"Cennsorship in Libraries       To remove something a person dislikes off of a shelf, is assuming other peoples opinions don't count. It really has to depend on what the product is. Such as a book, magazine, music album, or a movie. Usually in any store i've walked into, there are certain departments for each product. In these seperate departments, the product is always catagorized. Not from what people like, but by genera or age differences. If a person was to linger away from their section in that department and go to another part, their taste in their product will seem too different to like.      A local library in a persons commuinty will have many books to read and to choose from. There are baby books, kids sections, teenage and adults sections as well. The teenage section is for me! Although I used to always be in the kids section not that long ago, those books should now be removed because I have no use for them or wouldn't be interested in picking another one up. Yet that is just me. However the generation under me will soon love them. Just because one person dislikes something, doesn't mean it should be thrown out for everyone else.     Music is a different story. Some people like country and some people like alternative. In libraries they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to, before they rent it out. When I listen to one album to see if I like it and find out that I don't, I simply put it back on the shelf and try another one. The librarian doesn't throw it away because of my opinion, because to someone else it would be the sweetest music to their ears.      Anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion. Yet not all parents allow their twelve year old to watch a rated @CAPS1 movie. For them, it's only @NUM1 movies. This is how I grew up. Now that I am allowed to watch whatever my heart desires, i've noticed that movies are based on maturity levels. In libraries, some movies arn't allowed to be rented by a younger person. Yet it doesn't mean they should be tossed out. When they are older they might actually like them.     Overall a persons opinion will be the most important one to them. Other opinions wont matter. Products in a library are for anyone to view, not to judge. If absolutly everyone did judge the products, there wouldn't be any left",4,GPT4o,hs,Persuasive,"""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.

This reading selection takes me back to my fifth grade, and everyday my friends and I would help some kindergartner's read and sound out word. Books like Green Eggs & Ham, the Cat in The Hat, even Nursery rhymes. Later, on that school when i graduated from the fifth grade me and my friends were rewarded for our help. Right now i have a cousin that just graduated from high school last year, and tutor from grades 1st-5th. He's been doing this for 6 years. Most of the kids he tutored are now in middle school and still talks about him every time I see them. Then, littering isn't my thing i have never just threw some trash on the ground.

I do lots of things to do in my life, like play the bass guitar, play in my schools jazz band, play in my schools orchestra club, and with all of these talents i have i can teach them to some one out on the street and help the community by getting all of these hoodlums off the dangerous Detroit street and bring them to talents that they never knew that had.

I think that policy 1 that student can bring cell phone to school because you do think that bring cell phones is not important but it's good idea that they for allow in the schools .

For example is policy 2 said that not to bring cell phone want will happened with student have if is some big is happened in school and that you can't cell your parent and they think that some big is bad in the school .The policy 2 is not fair students have a chose to bring the cell phones to school and that the policy 1 be the one and fair to all students and that it will not cause trouble with anyone and that they . My point is that the use of the cell phones maybe of use but if the student use the cell phones in the free time that they can use it like lunch or in a place that can't see you use it but in the class the cell phones can be off or on vibrate so can't hear it when people are take to you.

MY POSITIONING ON COMMUNITY SERVICE IS THIS: WOULD YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WE MAY HAVE TO INHABIT ANOTHER PLANET BECAUSE OUR OWN PLANET IS FILLED WITH LITTER? THIS COULD HAPPEN, AND YES, IT MIGHT MAKE THIS SEEM MISLEADING, BUT THATS NOT THE POINT. WE SHOULDNT BE FORCED TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE. PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WORK IN COMMUNITY SERVICE FIGHT FOR

THEIR CAUSE, AN OTHER SUPPORTERS CAN STAND UP AND HELP. FORCING SOMEONE TO HELP

A CAUSE SHOULD BE AGINST THE CONSTITUTION. IF YOU WISH NOT TO FOLLOW, YOU DONT SHOULDNT HAVE TO. FORCING PEOPLE TO FIGHT AGINST A CAUSE THEY DONT WANT TO IS TAKING AWAY THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE, WHICH SHOULDNT BE ALLOWED. BUT, AS IN A CASE SUCH AS SOMEONE HAS BEEN SENTANCED BY A JUDGE TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR DAMAGE TO THE COMMUNITY, I CAN NOT SAY THAT IS WRONG. BUT EVEN THOUGH I SEE IT AS A BAD IDEA TO FORCE SOMEONE TO DO IT, I DIDNT SAY IT SHOULDNT BE A CLASS OF SOME SORT, LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU CAN GET CREDITS FOR HELPING PICK UP TRASH, OR HELP KIDS IN ELEMENTARY WITH WORK OF SOME SORT. IN

MIDDLE SCHOOL, WE COULD GET EXTRA CREDIT FOR ONE CLASS BY DOING COMMUNITY SERVICE. THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT SOLUTION, MORE PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO HELP, THROUGHOUT SCHOOLS. WE COULD AVOID THE FUTURE OF HAVING TO INHABIT ANOTHER PLANET, BUT WITHOUT FORCING PEOPLE TO HELP. THATS MY POINT. WE CAN DO EVERYTHING EFFICIANTLY, AND DO IT PEACEFULLY, AT THE SAME TIME.

36,"Dear @CAPS1, I belive that people are spending to much time one computors. I belive this and I have @CAPS7 reasons why. @CAPS2 first reason is that people waste money on it. Also every thing they get from the computer you get from book. And finaly @CAPS2 reason is because of the ""@CAPS8 crises."" @CAPS2 first reason for say that people spend to much time on the computer is that people waste two much money on it. I belive this because of your electric bill and and @CAPS3 bill. The people who have computer electric bill is always very high and for reason they are forced to pay @NUM1 or more dollars on electricity. This is also true becuse of the constant charging of laptops or running of computors. Also they have to pay @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to keep the @CAPS3 connection. So that bocome a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars going down the dawn. @CAPS2 second reason for this is that anything and every thing you can get on the @CAPS3 you can get from books. I belive this because where do you think the website makers get there info from. Reading books also increase your knoledge so that at any time you can quickly come up with an answer. Another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information. @CAPS2 third and final reason for this is that we are all dealing with this ""@CAPS8 crisis."" @CAPS7 people every day are getting less and less active because of computers.

I think that performing community service should be required because it will teach students that go to our school to be kind and giving back to the community will make them feel better. I also think it should be necessary because it will teach the students to be giving and it could change their personality in a positive way. I also think it would be good because some students might think it will be fun cleaning up, and you don't have to do it alone i am sure you would be able to do it with a friend. I am sure it will teach them something about giving and it will teach them a life lesson. I also am a believer in community service and i thing it is fun giving back to the community like that and afterwards i fell very happy and energetic about myself.

40,"Dear Mrs. Principal:

School can be very boring at times. With all the policies and rules we have to follow it makes it feel like we are in jail. Letting us have our phones out during free time we would all love. I think it would help us feel more comfortable, make us feel more responsible, and also it would let us communicate with friends that we don't see often.

My first reason for letting us have our phones out during our free time is that it would make us feel more comfortable. School is not fun at times and the clothes we have to wear we hate, but letting us have our phones out would make us feel like we are at home. That would make us more comfortable letting us concentrate more.

My second reason is it would make us feel responsible. I know this sounds silly but giving us this privilege would make us feel responsible. I believe this would causes us to work harder for the teachers because we have a more respect for them.

My third and final reason is it would let us communicate with our friends. We hardly get to see some of our friends through out the day. The only time we get to talk to them is after school and sometimes not for long because the teachers run us off. Letting us talk to them would make the day less stressful and fun.

All in all letting us have free time with our cell phones would actually help us learn. I know you probably don't believe me but being more comfortable, less stressed, and having fun actually helps us learn and pay attention more.

I think we students should at least have a B average to play sports, that would make it fair for who tries their best in school, but i bet that those who really love sports would try their best in all their classes. Students who do not try their be st and don't like sports they could just stay with whatever grade they get because they deserve it. Students who also have a bad attitude should not get to play either. If students really want to play sports or join activities they would really try hard not to be bad. If students have a 69 or below they should not let them play sports until they have a passing grade.

If many of the students have a C average they should try harder on their work for those who love sports and who like to join activities. I bet students who have a C average are mad because they cant play sports until they get a C average. I would like to convince the principal that they should at least get a B average. All students have to do is listen in class and pass all the test that teachers give out so you could pass the class and be able to pass your class and you'll be able to play what ever sport you want.

Students and people who try their best will always get everything they want because they do everything said and everything they tell them to do. doing everything they ask you to do will make you a good person. If you try your best you will get to play sports and join in activities you like. Your decision depends on you if you make a good decision you will get what you want if you don't you don't get everything that you want.

After reviewing the possible cell phone policies I have come to a conclusion that I support Policy 1. This policy allows students to use their cell phones for important or recreational uses that do not distract them during class time. Also with this policy they will be able to set up transportation and be able to feel secure in case of an emergency.

Policy 2 however, I feel will be ineffective and will not aide students in any way. If this policy is chosen students will most likely still bring their cell phones to school and because of the fact that they are not allowed to use them in free time they will most likely have to use them secretly during class. This will distract not only themselves but students around them. Also they may feel almost ""dared"" to bring their cell phones and try not to get caught.

The reason I feel that Policy 1 would be helpful is because if they are given certain periods of time when they can use them without having to face getting into trouble, the students will feel their is no need to use them during class. This will help them keep focussed during class along with others around them. Also they will be able to keep in touch and check in with their parents or guardians in case of an emergency or and important occurrence.

One of the main reasons students bring or even have cell phones today is for transportation purposes. If students are given a time during lunch or free time to use their cell phones and do this it will cut out the need to bring cell phones into the classroom or anywhere else in the school.

I believe that students will support this policy and respect the rules of it. If Policy 2 is put into play I believe students will take it lightly and not follow the rules. Also they may not feel as safe or secure in their school environment. In all, I believe that Policy 1 will help benefit not only the students but teachers as well and help the school environment become a more safe, secure, and focussed environment.

Considering a policy change for students to achieve a grade B average before they are able to participate in school activities such as basketball, baseball ,and other activities is a ethical proposal.

In most schools, children dream of becoming athletes with a colossal amount of fame, but the only obstacle they need to overcome is their poor averages in their overall classes. Children need to realize that they aren't going to get a scholarship to major athletic colleges unless they succeed in their classes. They need the education of those classes to pass major exams in their future careers. When they advance in life they will need to pass iq test ,or a drug test during their life, but they wont succeed because of their education.

One kid might become the worlds most famous baseball player with a humongous amount of money and lose all that money in a instant due to the fact that he or she was scammed, robbed or, blackmailed due to the fact that he or she did not receive the proper education they were supposed to receive, because they were too caught up in sports.

I am writing this letter to you about if students at SCHOOL_NAME should be require to do Community Service or not. While some students already have community hours and some don't, I think that we should be required to have community service hours. Some many say It takes up my time, or i don't have time to do anything for the community, but i think that that's just a excuse. If all students in the school had at least two hours of community service i think that our community would be a little better. While some kids already have done things for the community like volunteer at schools, fire stations, neighbors or just cleaning up the trash around your neighborhood, others think that

Most people don't care about how there neighbor hood is or about the community, what is more important is that it helps others out and that's what community service is all about. I do think that we should be required to have community service hours, if its only one hour or two hours of service at least.

I also think that it would be a great idea at our school if we make a group of students and get together twice a week and go clean up around the school or around the neighborhood. Most schools are not IB schools like our school is, but being a IB school i think we should be required IB (community service) hours.

I am writing this letter to you on the topic of the two possible policies you are considering regarding students having cell phones in school.

The one that I truly believe would best benefit our school is Policy 2: Not allowing cell phones in school.

This is better than Policy 1 for a number of reasons.

Did you know that 4 out of every 5 eighth graders has a cell phone?

If students were allowed to use their cell phones during free times such a lunch time those without cell phones would feel left out, excluded.

As a middle school we don't want any students feeling hat way for it could lead to stress and more serious matters.

Those that do have cell phones would make fun of these students and these distractions will likely affect all students grades as they would pay even less attention during class.

The question you are forced to ask when you deal with this topic is : What is causing these students to feel obliged to text and use their cell phones during class? Well yes they want to communicate with friends in other class and it's also fun to disobey the rules behind the teachers back.

However, the main reason is due to lack of interest in their academics.

More and more teachers are reverting to teaching methods solely based on note taking and book work.

Not only does this bore students to death but it awakens a rebellious nature within them that causes them to use their cell phones.

The method many students want learn with and will learn by is hands on experiments and class discussions.

This way students will feel more important and unique by being able to participate in class.

They will want to learn more and strive to do their best.

Although Policy 1 is a possible solution to the issue of students using their cell phones and their lack of attention during class it's just not a viable one.

Allowing them to use their cell phones during lunch and free time will have the opposite affect of what is meant of Policy 1.

Although students may continue to feel the urge to use cell phones during class after you enforce policy 2, their view on the matter will change after teaching methods are made better.

Not only will this solve the problem but it will boost student moral and grades.

Thanks for listening to my opinion.

I believe policy 1 is the best one because it allows us to talk with our friends and socialize more. We will not have our phones during class time because you gave us the privilege to have our phones at certain times. If a gunman had came into out school, the 911 call responder will defiantly get a call about an gunman in the school. Also have our phone in school ours is good because we can boost are socialism up and be more confident in our selves.

By having our phones in school a gunmen will surly not hurt as many people because the report of him in the school will surly be high and lots of policeman would come and bring him to custody. This will save lots of injury's that probably would of happen.

Having our cell phones in school will bring our socialism up because we could talk to people more and for victims of being bullied would be stop because you can be more social, that could be a nice avoid.

Having your socialism up you could get better grades, get into a good college then become a doctor or something else because you graduating with a diploma from college.

I do not think that requiring community service for students is a good idea. First, this will take time away from homework, studying, and extracurricular activities. Second, some students are in more sports, clubs, and activities outside of school than others, and wouldn't have much time for extra community service on top of that. Lastly, clubs are made that require community service in some schools, instead of making everybody required. If you required community service at our school, it wouldn't be a smart idea.

First, requiring community service for students will take time away from their homework, studies, and activities outside of school. Any student who is struggling to stay on top of the work load would start receiving failing grades because they get less time to study for tests and finish homework. Students with other activities going on would be rushed and stressed, as opposed to if they chose to join a club or group of students who wanted to do the community service.

Second, some students have more work, activities, and sports after school than others. For example, if some students have multiple sports, harder classes, and jobs before and after school, then it isn't fair to require them to complete as much community service as other students who get off with easy classes, and no sports or clubs. This new rule would be unfair to certain students. Maybe a club that requires anyone who isn't already in a club or sport to join and do community service would be a better idea.

Finally, requiring community service for all students is a bad idea. This would take time away from homework, studying, and any clubs or sports the students participate in. It would be unfair to the students that are involved in many other activities, as well as the students who aren't in these activities. A club that students could join voluntarily would be a much smarter choice. Thank you for your time.

I have heard about the new cell phone policies that you have been thinking of.

I feel that policy number 2 is the better one of the 2 choices.

hear are a couple of the reasons why I personally think this.

Students enjoy using their phone every day.

I feel that sometimes the can use it a little to much during school.

I think that letting students use their phones during lunch and free time is an excellent idea.

Also students wouldn't be interrupting class every day with their cell phones.

This would be a lot better than just getting rid of cell phones completely.

As principal you might want to consider possibly figuring out a schedule were students have free time during a couple of their classes.

Doing this would not only help the new policy, but keep it going throughout the school year.

students would appreciate it if during a boring class they got a 5-15 minute break to relax and use their phones.

But, there would be some rules behind the free time.

You would have to think of them so that students wouldn't be doing stuff that is against school rules.

So principal please consider the second policy for cell phones at our school.

students do want to use their cell phones and not keep them at home.

I hope you liked the reasons why please se",0qlGuDSssZf4vL3I1Dcy,GPT4o,ms,Persuasive,"Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. She is considering two possible policies:

I have heard you are having trouble making a decision on whether students should or shouldn't be required to do community service. I know many people who do community service including myself. From personal experience of community service i can tell you that it can help the way you think and act around certain types of people and ethnic groups. I am not say there is a different way to act around others, although it would be unprofessional to act like you do with your friends around the president of the United States. Therefore all students should be required to perform community service acts.

One of the main reasons community service should be essential is because students now a days have more time to do these things and it would greatly impact our communities. For example if one student did community service by picking up trash in a near by park we could prevent people from overseeing these parks just because it is has trash every where. Another great example of community service having a big impact on our community is helping at the annual food drive. This could impact millions of people that are in dyer needs of food and you never know but you could collect 5 cans that could possibly be the difference between life or death.

I know it may sound funny but picking up trash or collecting food at a food drive doesn't take much effort but it does leave a big impact and i know that students are age are perfectly capable of doing these small tasks.

Doing such a little thing to a community could make a big difference for many people, so if i were in your shoes trying to make a decision about community service i would definitely say yes not only because i do this myself but because the people that we could be effecting need our help. Thank you for considering the following things that i have put up to offer. I hope your decision goes well and i know when it comes down to it u will make the right choice.

I think that all students should at least perform a little bit of community service. I think it would help kids from being all stuck up and then they would probably like to do community service without being forced to do it. I really think that kids should do community service to help animals, plants, and anything they need to save from dyeing from the trash or anything that could hurt them. I do what ever i can to keep the earth clean and safe i really would appreciate it if you would help me get kids outside and to go around town with me to do community service to help people around the house to fix peoples yards or gardens or even fences. to like rebuild them and paint them. i would be very thankful because we should take at least a couple of minutes or even a couple of hours.

The school policy has always stated that you can play sports or participate in activities, as long as you are passing every class. Many students are trying really hard to at least make a C average in every class, just because they are athletic and they want to play sports. The athletic students are the ones that usually struggle in school because they do not have as much time to study, because sports are so time consuming. The majority of the school makes a C average, changing the policy to having to make at least a B average is not going to make kids do better in school, it is just going to persuade the kids not to play school sports.

If you change the policy, volleyball, track, tennis, football, and many other sports will have less kids and a smaller chance of winning. Not only do most students try their best, but they also have to juggle all sorts of things. Sometimes school isn't always everyone's' top priority. Yes, school is important, but so is social skills and athletic skills. School already takes up most if every kids day, and now you expect it to take up more time by forcing them to make a higher grade? No child tries to fail and keep their grades low, therefore they are trying very hard in school, and now sports are going to get taken away from them.

How would you feel if your job was based on how high your IQ was, and if it was a certain number, you could not have a job? Most people would not be too pleased, and that is exactly how you are making all of the students at the school feel. Sports should focus mainly on your athletic skills, and school should focus on your mental skills. A child's mind doesn't determine their physical ability.

The two terms given are policies that both have reasonable pros and cons to each subject. Allowing students to bring phones to school and obligating them to use such devices during lunch periods and free times as long as the phones are off during teaching periods is one possibility. On the other hand, banning cell phones from school at any time and at any hour is another choice.

Although these policies hold different views and opinions to them, letting students carry cell phones in school should be authorized.

In any case of an emergency, students who are allowed to have a cell phone during lunch breaks and other free time can contact those in times of an emergency. Parents have always been concerned of the fact that in times of genuine trouble, they are not able to reach their child. Lock downs and fires are always a huge possibility during school and parents always stress that they must be the first to know the condition of their child. In case of any emergency, a student can call for help using a cell phone, arousing the awareness of others, such as teachers and students.

In addition to emergencies, schools that let students hold cell phones show a basis of trust and understanding of the student's predicament. Trust is an immense foundation that children need to learn to have and form with other individuals in society today. By letting students realize that they can be trusted, they themselves will show more respect and credence towards adults. To be responsible in life is a goal that each individual must achieve. Starting with trust, students will learn to be responsible. Their understanding of the rules and regulations that go along with privileges will be made clear and those who break such rules will face the necessary consequences.

Allowing cell phones in school during appropriate times is not necessarily a necessity, but a privilege that should be given to responsible students. For emergency purposes, the use of cell phones may lessen any casualties during schools hours. As a life goal, our community must instill trust with each other and hold the responsibilities with such privileges.

Therefore, the first step is to allow cell phones in school for the use of rational purposes only during specified times.

You asked for student's opinions on the subject of the new school rule that concerns whether students should be able to participate in after-school activities or sports if they have a C or lower average. I do think this is a good idea. This new rule can be a motivation for students who slack off in school, and now they can have a reason to work harder.

A grade of a C is a passing grade, so students think it's all right to not work any harder because they're already passing. However, a C is not what students should strive for. Taking away privileges, such as after-school activities or sports, is an excellent way to make students work harder to get a B. However, I do think you should either allow them to go to study sessions or start study groups to help them achieve and maintain a B or an A.

In addition, this would help our whole school learn things faster, because students will have to work to receive maintain a B or an A, unlike when they had a C. Although this might cause the sports teams or school clubs to lose members, I think it is worth it. I believe that students should be more concerned about their grades than their clubs or sports. I also think that parents would be more proud of their children for trying harder in school because of the motivation.

Also, teachers would be happier with the students because they are working harder. If the students pay more attention in class and do their homework, and stay after for extra help, the teachers will be happier and more encouraging because the students are trying hard. Furthermore, the students with a C average will learn that they have to work hard to achieve a goal, and that maintaining a B or an A average takes work and determination.

I believe this new school policy of ""Having a B average will allow you to participate in after-school activities and sports"" is a great one. I think it will help students work harder, teachers being more encouraging, and overall help our school.

I want your students to do community service, like picking up litter or help someone to do community service.

They could help the planet if they do community service some examples are, picking up litter, recycling, reusing, donating, and reducing some of their stuff from home or from someone's house.

Recycling- you can recycle stuff like any kind of plastic bottles, paper, and glass so that your students will learn community service easier.

Reusing- you can reuse all of storage bowls and dishes that you barely use you and your students can go to like a lake and pick up litter, then they can start reusing some of it.

Donating- the stuff that your students have in their house, that they don't use anymore they can donate it to a really good charity for the poor or for the homeless, or if they have any little brothers or sisters they could get some of their old toys or something that they don't use anymore they could donate it like to a daycare or homeless children.

Reducing- you and your students can reduce about anything that you have in your household.

Littering- your students should not ever litter, because it would give the community some hard work and it would take up most of their social time with their families, so make sure that none of your students never litter any where.

You and all of your students could go to a resort or lake so that they would get the feeling of community workers when they have to clean up litter on the grounds of the resort or lake.

Your idea about all students having to do community service is a wonderful idea. Now of days people just throw stuff on the ground thinking its not a big deal, but it is. If all people do is just throw garbage on the streets it will make the Earth look like a garbage dump. It is also bad for our environment. Animals eating it thinking its food and choking to death. Then if people throw it into the water the fish die from it. If students get involved it'll make the world or there town cleaner. then plants, and animals won't die from the waste that comes from the garbage. if you want students to do community service I'm okay with this idea. I'm sure all the other students would be fine with this to.

I also have another idea on getting them to do so. give the assignments as homework. Each day you assign the assignment make this the only homework you give them so they would do it. By doing this it'll give them something to do that doesn't require having to think. It'll also make them like recycling and helping the environment.

Not all students enjoy doing community service or helping out other people. Yes it would be nice if some of them did take the time out to help. If you asked me for my option on this I would say no. For example some students might have to go home and watch their little brother/sister, and just don't have the time. While other kids might have a sport they play in and they have practice.

If you made everybody perform community service it would be crazy. Like I said before not only do students have things to do, but they might already be involved in an activity. As a student

I don't have time to do some things due to homework. Now just think would you rather for us to complete a certain amount of community service or get an education? Now once which one would you rather us do? Yes of course get an education! I know If I was you I would want my students to complete all their work, and then worry about staying after for school.

Now if the student had a little extra time maybe he/she might want to help the kids at the elementary school or even go volunteer at the animal shelter. Say a student jus got a call from their mother and it was a family emergency what do you expect them to do then? Yea giving back by helping another by student is a good idea, but not all kids have the time. Once again TEACHER_NAME my opinion on all students have to do community service is no.

How are you doing today? I would like to give you my opinion on kids doing community service. I think it is a good idea for kids to do community service despite what they want to do. Community service shows discipline, dedication, and leadership. Today I will be explaining why I think community service should be required for all students. Please sit back, relax, and read along.

The first reason why I think students should be required to do community is because it teaches discipline. It teaches discipline because it keeps you focus and not letting you get caught up. For example, there is so many negative things going on these days, and if you are doing something good with your time, you don't have time for the negativity. It also shows discipline because community service is something that you have to do consisting, so community service is something that you have to do, and be dedicated to doing it. This is my first reason why I think all students should be required to do community service.

Next, community service teaches students how to be a good citizen. By doing community service for along time, eventually students will start picking up trash, helping people, and things like that when their not doing community service. They do those things because that is just the person they have become from doing community service. Community service teaches a lot of good things and how to be good citizen is one of them. Citizenship is a great quality to have.

Lastly, community service shows leadership. It shows leadership because some of the students friends might not be doing it, but for a student to still do it, that is showing leadership. Also because in your neighborhood your being a leader by, picking up trash, helping",GPT4o,luY8g5nAEgnojuFd3kdI,ms,Persuasive,"Some of your friends perform community service.

In my opinion, I believe you should require all students to preform community services at SCHOOL_NAME. I believe this for many reasons. The first reason being is that there are hundreds of kids at our school, and if each person does one community service , that doesn't even have to be big, think of how that could all add up! We could be changing the community one step at a time. When I say the service doesn't have to be big, I mean the smallest things such as throwing a couple of plastic bottles in a recycling bin or picking up some litter you see on the side of the street or in you neighborhood. My second reason being is there are some elderly people in Austintown that could use some help with simple everyday things, such as getting their mail or shoveling their driveway. Just doing those little things for a neighbor or friend could leave a great impression on Austintown children. But adults aren't the only ones that need help. There are elementary school children that struggle in school, such as math or any subject at all. As sixth, seventh, and eighth graders we should be good role models and help them with their weaknesses. We could tutor them after school for an hour making sure we get progress done. I understand that some students have after school activities, such as a sport event, so they would not be required to tutor. But it would be mandatory for them to do some type of service, such as picking up litter everyday. When all of these community services add up, we will be influences for Canfield and Boardman and other cities and they will do the same. When we come together like this, we can make a difference. Some students that disagree with this may thing the community is no big deal, but it is much more bigger than they think. Remember, a clean community is a happy community and when we all come together we can make a difference. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you take it into consideration.

Some people don't understand why it isn't okay to litter. I think i would be a great idea to litter. I think this because students can learn not to litter and help out are environment too. this is good for everybody it shows we have the entiative to help out making earth a cleaner safer place for everyone. But community serves id not just for cleaning up the earth its for also helping people who need us. For example like an elderly home or reading to the blind. There's just so many ways we can help people we just need a little push.

Kids are age don't care if they litter or not but i bet they would if they new how it affected are environment. Litter can hurt living things because they think its okay for them to use but its not some animals try to eat that stuff or build a nest out of it. This could be dangerous for them. Also most of the trash ends up it streams, lakes, or ponds. Soon there's no water left for the animals or the plants and they so start to die.

When we help someone out it might make us feel better and more alert of out surroundings. And plus your making someone's day. When we help out other people it shows that we have good leadership skills. When you take time out of your day to help someone or something your making an effort to help make somebody a little bit stronger.

Our school should promote community serves to promote that we actually care.

Community Service is a very important aspect of life.

As a firm believer in this, I would ask you to consider that all students of SCHOOL_NAME take part in community service.

As Christians, we are called to administer to the needs of the poor, but if this school is not pushing for it than how are we fulfilling our duties as Christians?

Whether it's working in soup kitchens downtown or helping babysit a neighbor, we should be striving to answer our call from God.

I have done community service with my peers and during my experiences, I have encountered many people from various ages, genders, races, and social classes.

From every trip I have gained a valuable experience.

During one of my experiences, I was working in a soup kitchen in downtown Cleveland.

Although intimidating at first, I helped by serving those who didn't have the same gifts I am blessed with.

Isn't that what we are called to do?

Serve others like Jesus did?

I learned from this that every human person is valuable and should be treated with dignity and respect.

Wouldn't you like all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME to participate in such a great journey of faith and attempt to carry out what we are taught by Jesus Christ?

I believe by helping our society to become a better place is why we are put here on this earth, but we shouldn't be wasting our time and talents by selfishly keeping our gifts to ourself.

We are called to share those gifts with others.

Simply, I am asking that you implement at least ten hours of community service for the entire school year.

That is only a little over an hour of community service per month.

By doing this, we will come closer to God and to those around us.

I am STUDENT_NAME, an eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME. I disagree with your plan to require a 'B' average in classes to participate in sports. Many students are smart and apply themselves, but do not fully understand subject material.

Do not think that they are not trying to get a good grade; They just need more help understanding the material. I know many very smart students who have difficulty with a certain subject. they care about getting a good grade, and want to do well. Not many of the se people play sports, but this new policy you have proposed will still affect them. Many students have a 'C', and they just need to get better help for that. I believe that doing sports helps a student get better grades, as they have a drive to continue, so as not to get kicked off their team. They will also have time to exercise and stretch while playing sports, which increases cardiovascular activity. You yourself said that ""The best way to prepare is to get your blood pumping through cardiovascular activity"".

Blood flow increases cognitive activity, which will help students achieve better grades because they will understand the subject matter better. Sports allow students to take a break from school and have some time with their friends. They will want to stay with their freinds, so they have another motive to try harder and get good grades. Thank you very much for your time.

66,"Dear audience I am writing to you about heroes.  What makes a hero?  To me a hero is someone who improves society through their achievements.  Thomas Edison is a hero to me because he improves society through his perseverance in creating the light bulb, his determination in building a laboratory where more inventions could be created, and his tremendous focus when making the motion picture.   	Edison, to me, is a hero because of how he persevered on working on inventing the light bulb.  He tried countless materials and failed nearly every time.  He tried around 1500 times just to make the light last longer.  He tried different materials, such as carbonized bamboo filament, to try and get the new light bulb which was a carbonized filament in an oxygen free bulb and it was successful.  His new invention, the light bulb, burned for close to 200 hrs.  Edison made the light bulb available to ordinary people not just the rich which helped society.   	Edison was determined when he built a place where new inventions could be created.  He was successful in creating a laboratory in Menlo Park.  This laboratory was important to society because it allowed his staff to discuss ways to improve on everyday items and ideas.  Many different inventions were created in Menlo Park.  	Edison had tremendous focus when he invented the motion picture device called the Kinetoscope.

69,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly think that manypeople are not benefiting fromusing computers. There are so many more things people can do besides go on the computer. By using the computer, people are getting less exercise, not enjoying the nature, and not interacting with family or friends. By using the computer, people are not getting many benefits. As i mentioned, people who use computers too much are getting less exercise. By not exercising, this could really affect people's health. From recent studies by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people whouse computers too much are overweight. That is an extremly high statistic! By computers affecting this many people's lives is ridiculous. This many people really shouldn't be over weight. If these people aren't getting exercise they could become addicted to the computer. If peopole are getting addicted to the computer they @MONTH1 start to do bad things with the computer. They could publish bad things go on ridiculous websites, and watch horrible things. The worst is probably watching bad things. It really puts a bad influence on everyone. Lastly, if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes. If you are staring at the computer all day, your eyes @MONTH1 not be used to seeing everything else. It's hard for your eyes to transfer from seeing one thing to the next. Clearly, being on the computer is bad for health. Not enjoying nature is also something that people aren't benefiting from. As you @MONTH1 know, getting freshair is good for everyone. Its always nice to smell the nice @DATE1 air after being in school all day. Many people dont do this because as soon as they get home its to the computer. These people are losi a lot of refreshment. I recently interviewed @PERSON1 she told me that, ""many people don't get to see what's on in the world because of computers."" They never take that to look at anything thats going on around them. By keeping updated. You never know what topic @MONTH1 pop up in school you could always benefit from checking on mother nature. Lastly, there are always animals that need help. Have you ever been in a situation where a stray dog needs a home i have and by helping these animals you're saving life. Many people dont have this opportunity because they are on the computer. Obviously, there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature. My last reason is hat by being on the computer you're not interacting with family or friends. In some cases, the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent. If you're a parent you need to help your family with everyday chores. I know, they can be innoying to have to do but you're helping your family and thats all you can do. Also, if you are a parent that has children they always need help. Some kids are younger and don't know how to find information for a project. But, that's why a parent is there. But, if the parent is on the computer they aren't able to fulfill this requirement. I know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger. Lastly, family parties and computers do not mix. From past experience, when family has come over my brother has sat on the computer without even coming to say ""hello"" to anyone. I find this extremly rude. I just hope that family members don't get offened by this. Clearly, using the computers takes time away from family. In conclusion, people should have limited time on computers.

71,"Dear newspaper I think that there are many reason why computers are good for people. Compters are good for people because they help keep friends conected. Reason two is that they can be great knowledg   for people. @CAPS1 third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team based and help people with teamworks and team building skills. Those are three of the many reasons why I think that computers are good for people and have had a positive effect. First of all, I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, go to a colledge far away, or move because of a job you will most likely, if @CAPS5 is further away, loose connection with you friends. But, using a computer can solve that problem. In social networking sites like @CAPS3, twitter and myspace you can simpily look up your distant friends from  you previoulsy lived and have contact with them. Youi can catch up with each other, recall good times you've had, end maybe make plans to meet each other sometime. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer. Experts also say that @CAPS5 is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier. I have had an experience when a scoial networking site has reconnected me with a @CAPS2. When i was younger I had a @CAPS2 whos grandmother lived  to @CAPS1 dad. After a little over a year of  him being good friends be moves to @LOCATION1, I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year I also moved to a different town, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 searched me on @CAPS3 and we got connected again, I have found out he moved back to where I use to live. That is the first reason I think that computers are @CAPS4 good for people. The second reason, @CAPS5 is that computers can be great knowledge scources for people. If you ever need to set information   that not have to  through the  of book,then, a computer is the thing for you. As long as you than  to find an accurate and reliable scourse than a computer. Is an amazing tool. You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find locks of information on @CAPS5. Statistics show that you can find @PERCENT2 more information on a computer than a book. Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolite and computer will rain  as knowledge scources. That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people. Last of all, I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills. What I  by programs is yes of course videogames. Almost all of the computer games out have multiplayer features. Withins the multiplayer universe there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork. In the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win. And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork. That is @CAPS1 third reason why I think computers are good for people.

I don't really agree with your decision because three are many people that try there best and the still get a c as there average.

But then it would be great to change the police because people that have C,D,E,F, well get A,B for order them to secrecies there grades to play and get good grads people well change and make the school better. well that's what i think in between both of them. this is the way i think because people these days are dropping out of school for the bad grade and i think i would be a grate police to change.

74,"Dear principal

I have heard that you may want to change the policy for cell phone use during school hours. I believe that kids, as well as adults, should be able to use cell phones.

Here's my reason: we all may receive texts or calls during the day that may be important.

Such as a family member or pet in serious danger or injured. Our car or house being robbed and damaged.

Also, the students may have homework or late work they may need to catch up on, they could use there cell phones as calculators or online dictionary. You may not believe that there are educational tools on our phones, so let us prove to you that we just don't text on our phones.

I know you are a woman of high character ,and may not give this much thought, but please give this a consideration. My vote is for policy 1. Thank you

I think that's a good and bad idea because first of all some students get bad grades and some get good grades and if they get bad grades they wouldn't like the school because they will think that they would never be able to do what ever sport that want.

Second of all, the students that get bad grades will worry about getting good grades and then they will say forget this or they won't even care about what the get. Its also good though because if people in the school don't participate in gym and art and stuff like that than well this school policy will be good for them. If they have a C then they might as well just give them a B or make them do extra credit so they would have a B.

Third of all not every body likes to do sports, but the people that like to do sports I think usually get bad grades and the people that get good grades don't really like do sports, but the school policy thing is good because school comes before and thing else because you can't be playing a sport and not have a education that won't make sense.

76,"Dear principal,

You should not require community service. If people don't want to do it then that's their own opinion. And some people also may not have the time to do community service so don't push it upon them to do it. Some people think helping the community is a nice and good thing to do them let them do it maybe you could have an activity for people who would like to do that and they could get extra credit and letters of recommendation for something. And the people that don't want to do it maybe are against it for some odd reason but then again they might just not have the time to do it, they might have cheer or dance, baseball, football that kind of stuff going on after school. But also the people that don't want to do it you could just ask maybe say here try something new you might like making the community cleaner or a better place.

Here's and idea if some students get in trouble say for littering or for bullying, getting into fights, never turn in the homework, are disrespectful and disruptive to the teacher and to the class then they could do community service for 2 days or so it could depend on how bad the case was. Cleaning up the environment and making a better situation out of something would maybe make them realize what they have done and they may not do it anymore.

For people that would like to do community service maybe you could get them to have their friends that don't want to do it try it. They could let them know that it makes you feel good about yourself and makes you feel like you just helped a lot. And maybe they will even end up liking it a lot you could create a little club for the people that like it and have them make posters for community service and on them say you could get extra credit, letters of recommendation, and be recognized with the group that they are doing the service with.

So i hope you take this letter and think about what choice you will pick on your little conflict.

77,"Dear principle,

I believe that the policy shouldn't change the same because lot of students would like to participate in sports such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, or other sports. Some students have difficulty's in subject's. Instead of having to get a B+ we should leave it the way it is. That way more student would participate in sports. Many students believe that this new policy is unfair because they could be having a problem in math or other subjects and they might not get the help they need. Honestly i agree with them. Teachers might also be pressuring them to cutch or not teaching well. Also, there are some students that do there homework and get good grade in quizzes but when it comes to the test they forget everything like they never even learned it. I also believe that the student's should get more help after school or at lunch that way the have more possibility's to succeed and then they would get better grades and would be able to participate in sports. Now that's what i think that should happen if you make the new policy. also other students wouldn't just want to participate in just sport they might want to go in an art class or would want to be in leadership. Now i also believe that you are being to harsh on the students. They might want to join a sport or other activities but they wont be able to because of there grades. Students come here to learn and get to spend more time with there friends but most of all they would want to participate in fun activities that way they wont get so bored in class or in school. Many other students don't have nothing to do at home they would get bored of playing video games or the same thing over and over again.

I think that you should allows students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times. This would be really fun to do so that the students can text their friends and wont be using their cell phones during class. If you let us do this we will make sure we have our phones off for class. some students would think this is a really good idea to because a lot of students love to text during school and since we are not allow to have cell phones during school hours students still text anyways and if you let us use our cell phones during lunch period or any other free times then students wouldn't have to worry about texting in class and getting their cell phones taken away. when the students text at school and get caught the teacher takes their phones away.

If you let us use our cell phones during lunch time you wouldn't have to worry about taking the cell phones away or anything. I believe this is a good policy because if u don't allow students to use their phones some students don't care and will use it anyways and that's why they get caught and their phones get taken away and then their parents have to come get it and its just a lot of mess.

If you think this policy is good then you would use it. I know a lot of other students would really like this policy to not just me but everyone else.

A lot of students love to text in school and they pay more attention to their phones then learning in class. And if u let us use this policy i think that more students would pay more attention in class since their phones would be turned off. If you don't think is a good policy then their are a lot of other ones.

Us students have a problem with the changes you are making in our school.

We disagree with the not participate in sports or any activities unless we have at least a B average , many students in our school are great at playing sports and with many more activities , but the more students that have a c average many not participate in these activities .

This is not fair to our school we will have a camp ain of student that are great at sports and activities and the once that are very smart to get together and study so we can keep participating on these activities. We need these thing to keep us going in school for our health , trying something new , helping each other, being friendly with others , and making new friends, if you let this happen we would be on track with our school work and not giving up and trying our best to have and get a B average or even an A average, we will become successful by the time you approve of this letter, we took our time to write it and we hope you will think about our deal.

I believe that students should perform community service. Students like me have it to easy. Now don't get me wrong students do work hard, However not hard enough. Lets take my friend for example he does no work at home or at school, Yet he still has a playstation three. He lives in Atlantic City New Jersey. He tells me that there is plastic and all sorts of litter on the ground and there is no one there to pick it up. Right here in Central Islip there is litter on the ground and I see no one pick it up. I am upset to see this. I want people to come in Central Islip and say what a clean city with educated kids. Not what a dirty city with stupid kids.

I don't think it is a good idea to change the grade point average that is required to participate in sports.

Some of the players would get kicked off the team because they just have a C and that could effect the whole team.

It could also effect your school because maybe the players are just so stressed from having to try to get a B instead of just a C.

A C is still a good grade.

A C is still passing and it shows that the person may not understand but he still try's.

When I get a C its because I tried but i don't quite understand the information.

I know a lot of kids that would be happy with just a C and they actually try in class.

My friend was on the basketball team and he got decent grades.

I remember that when projects came up he would be really stressed and I would help him out with his school work.

He would try but on certain things he felt like it was just way to hard.

Imagine if he had to get B' s, he would have been all stressed all the time and it was hard for him to just to get good enough grades just to be able to play a sport that he really loved.

Some kids are stressed and they don't really have to get grades good enough to play any sport.

I try for good grades and its easy because I have all the time after school to do my homework or maybe just work on a project that will be due.

The players on the team have to go to practice and then after that they do there homework but I would think they would be tired from having to practice for about on hour.

When I am tired I don't always do my best and that could effect grades.

The players have a lot to handle and raising what grades they have to have in order to play ,may just make them quit.

It sucks when you have to quit something you love just because its way to hard to keep balance.

If you raise the grade point average it will tip the balance and make it hard to be a basketball player.

Please don't change the grade point average.

I think that helping the community is a good thing to do for the school. Cleaning up or picking up the trash from side walks, the grass, from rivers or lakes or anything like that. We could learn lots of things like math like picking up one plus two more makes three. We could do science by saying their are so many germs and different kind of germs and what could they be.

It is important to pick up litter so that the earth wont get polluted. If we don't pick up the litter its going to effect the earth. We could also take half that wants to pick up litter and let them pick it up for maybe a hour or two.

Then we can get the other half that didn't, let them do work until the other half came. When they did the half that didn't want to pick up litter, they could have their work finished and let them pick up litter for an hour or two. But if that wouldn't work we could start a club or a meeting after school for the students that wanted to pick up litter come and join the club.

If it helps the earth from pollution or anything bad happening to the earth i think we should help the community. I think we should do it so it wouldn't make our school look bad in any way. so people wont think that we don't care about our school. so i think helping the community is a good idea.

85,"Do you believe driverless cars are really safe? Even though driverless cars could be very helpful to people in some situations, I am against the development for driverless cars. Driving isn't supposed to be fun, because driving should be safe at all times. In my opinion cars are at their zenith.

First of all, driving a car isn't supposed to be fun, it's suppose to be safe. With driverless cars you have to be alert 100 percent of the time because these cars aren't comepletely driverless. These cars could cause many accidents. If the driver isn't completey alert and if an accident is ahead what is the car supposed to do? When driving, the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are supposed to be safe. Can a car that is in control 90 percent of the time ensure that?

Secondly, cars are at the zentih of development. Most cars today have everything you need to be, ""safe"". Cars today have radar sensors, position- estimating sensors, a video camera mounted near the rear view mirror, a GPS receiver, and a Dubbed Lidar. All of those things promote safety when driving. The person driving doesn't have to know when to take control of the vehicle because they are already in control. What more could a car possibly need?

I am against the development of driverless cars. Cars are already developed and shouldn't need anymore done to them. They are safe enough. Driving isn't supposed to be fun. These cares could cause accidents if the driver isn't completely alert.

Secondly ,the reason why i agree cause if they are in class and the sports they want to do is today then they are going to be thinking about the sport. Not there school work and i think that school goes first before playing sports.

finally, my reason why i think that its a right in school probably because, they are going keep getting bad grades in the class and not going to be focus on the education but on the sport so i don't think they have the right to play sports and get away with it.

87,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to take classes from home?

I believe that if students had to make the decision to take classes online or come to school, they would most likely pick school but personally i'd be the one taking the online classes. Besides some of the teens nowadays would recommend online, but then again the middle school and below would rather be at school because they are younger and into school while teens prefer to be at work or hanging out with an friend. Therefore that opportunity would have defiantly been token advantage of well by the teens. Because the younger kids arent really to worried about being home or hanging out because all of there friends and fun are at school not at home.

In my opinion, high school should be online classes only; Because at this point if you look at the results on how many children actually come to school when theyre in high school vs when theyre in middle school/elementary it would be a big difference in attendance records. everyone would literally be passing because its online an you dont have to come to school you can literally lay in your bed and do your work. Besides your gonna have a lot of time on your hands because your not in a school you dont have to switch classes, eat lunch, go to the locker, class changes none of that so you have a lot of time to complete all of your work.

So therefore if my school offered online classes, that would be greatly token advantage of by me and most of the students that go here. The teachers wouldnt even have worry about the work not getting done. Because you have so much time on your hands to get the work done you cant even complain or fail and if you do your just not trying at all and must not care if you graduate or not, And thats not good you should want to graduate no matter what it takes.

With as many companies working towards driverless cars: Google, Toyota, BMW, GM, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan, I think we'll have streets full of the in no time.

I think driverless cars are a fantastic idea.

Humans have flaws, and machines do too, but if we could manufacture a car smart enough to know how to navigate in traffic on its own, and when and where to stop a humans flaws would not be an issue.

We have too many distractions in our lives, and needless to say we're thinking about those things while we're driving.

""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" -paragraph 5.

This indicates that driverless cars are safer than manual ones, and that they use less energy.

With cars as sensitive as these, there would be fewer accidents as well.

There are a few issues with the case: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" -paragraph 9.

On the other hand, by the time driverless cars are on the streets we should have most legal issues worked out.

89,"Driverless cars are not a good idea and I am not for them. Driverless cars are very expensive to begin with. Uprgrades to public roads need to be done for the Smarter Cars to be driven on. The massive upgrades to the roads will also cost too much money.

Self driven cars still do not meet all safety measures, that's why it is illegal to drive on the road with them in most states. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. They all require the driver to drive throught work zones and around accidents. Why shouldn't the driver just drive all the time if you have to drive through little things like work zones? Driving doesn't require much skill besides being aware of your surroundings. What else do you have to do in a car on the road? Driving should be a basic human skill for all people in the world today.

Almost all driving laws help secure the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Keeping these laws are best achieved with alert human drivers. You never know when the computer in the car will malfuction, or when the devices will just suddenly stop working. If the technology fails, the blame goes on the manufacturers. There will most likely be a lot of court cases that the car companies will have to deal with if the cars malfuction.

The self driving cars will cost a lot less money on gas, nearly 50 percent of gas will be saved. But the money that you save on gas, doesnt make up for how much the car will cost, how much the upgraded roads will be, and the risk you are taking letting a computer drive you around wherever you want to go, even when you have to do some of the driving yourself. The cost of the gas does not make up for how much everything else will cost.

I am not for driver less cars. Most of the self driving cars will come down to two things, money and safety. It will cost to much money for everything with the cars besides gas.

The first disadvantage is driverless cars are not safe. Driverless cars have sensors that are supposed to detect and respond to danger. Suppose while the driverless car is turning, one of the sensors does not pick up another car. the driverless car will turn anyway becuase it does not know better, and the cars will crash.

94,"Driverless cars sounds like a good idea, but if you really think about it, is it really? A car that can drive itself could come with many other problems. Personaly I don't think its that good of an idea. In the following paragraphs I will be explaining why I am not for driverless cars.

Basically driverless cars are controlled automatically by like a computer. Think about all the times you've had an issue with things messing up with your computer or cellphone. If smartphones have technical problems some times, what makes you think a smartcar won't? Imagine driving on a busy street or a highway and something going wrong with the car and you not being able to control it. Someone could end up seriously hurt, or dead.

In the article it says how the car would still need the drivers assistance in situations such as navigating through work zones or around accidents. I feel like because this car is designed to steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves the driver would be less aware while on the road and if for any reason needed to take charge of the wheel they wouldn't do it fast enough because they are not being as focused on the road as they would be with a normal car you drive yourself.

Also, if these cars were to start being more used there would have to be more laws made in order to cover liability in the case of an accident.

There would have to be a lot of work put into these cars being able to be used.

I don't think technology is advanced enough for a driverless car to be completely safe. Cars controlled by a person aren't even completely safe, a car controlled by a computer definitely isn't.

The use of this technology can change the preception of schooling. In the artice, Dr. Huang predicts that the classroom computer will be able to modify the lesson when it recognizes a student is becoming confused or bored. This will help students who struggle to understand some class material. The computer can, based on the students emotion, change the way the material is seen, heard, and understood. If a computer can read the emotions of someone who is trying to study, it can alter the way the person studies to make it easier and more enjoyable. This can help graduation rates rise and dropout rates lower.

Some may argue that using this technology isn't fair to the students. That students emotions shouldn't be read by a computer. That to understandable. However, some students are afraid to ask for help because they don't want to be precieved as dumb or unintelligent. With this system, the students emotions will be confidentually read and then used to help the student.

Whether you are the youngest child, the oldest, or even a parent, you will find yourself struggling to figure out where you belong and who is in charge. In the play “A Raisin in the Sun”, Lourainne Hansbury shows how Mama uses her familial hierarchy to do what is best for her family though the characters’ actions, societies expectations, and gender roles.  Each member of the Younger family has their own idea of how the money from their father’s inheritance would be best suited. Beneatha and Waiter Lee’s arguments lead Mama to the realization of her own family’s competative and strong willed nature.

98,"Exploring venus, Venus is sometimes called the evening star it is the brightest points of light in the dark sky, It makes it simple for amateur stargazer to spot it this nickname for it is misleading, venus is actually a planet in the solar system, venus is second over from the sun, Venus is very easy to spot it is a safe vantage point of earth it has a very challenging place to look at more closely. venus reffered to as a twin from the earth venus is actually one of the closes that means size and density, our planetary neighbor knows that that it oribit the sun at diffrent speeds.

A atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus. A even more challanging is the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. On our planet's surface the tempature can average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and that is really hot, The atmospheric pressure can be 90 times greater than what we can experience on our planet. The conditions are more extreme than we can encounter, Venus is the hottest surface tempature of any planet in the world, Mercury is closer to the sun high pressure and heat can geology and present additional impediments like erupting colcanoes every where earthquakes and some lightning probes seeking to land on surface.

Nasa has particularly idea to send human to study and discover venus. The possible solution to the hostile condition is the surface of venus we would allow scientists to float above. Dream like there is a blimp-like car floating 30 miles roiling to venusian landscape. Our jet planes can travel higher and they can fly over many storms and a vehicle hovering up there would not be a good idea.

Nasa is working on other approaches to get to venus some simplieifed the chaos of venus surface and have lasted for a long time in such conditions just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin.

99,"For many years scientist and mechanics have been trying to create a car that drives on its own. Over the years, they have come close to creating that car, and soon they'll have is made. I personally feel like it's a bad idea to create this car, even though there are some good points to it.

I get car sick, and I'm sure many people in this world get car sick too. I have found that when I drive, I don't get car sick, one reason it that I'm keeping my mind busy and focus on driving. With self driven cars I would not be driving, so I'll get car sick, I would rather walk to my destination, than get sick and dizzy because of driverless car. However, you're probably thinking ""I don't car sick."" So letting me move on. Everyday someones computer crashes, phones freeze, or their eletronic device's battery runs out. What does this have to do with the car? Well, I'm glad you asked. If this is a driverless car it is a known fact that it'll be electronic. So imagen you're driving in the high way when you're car manlfunctions and shuts down. If you can't get you're car under controll quick enough you'll crash right in to the person in front or beside you. Technology is known to fall apart and malfuntion all the time, so most likely this driverless car will cause more accidents.

This idea of a driverless car is not all bad. There are some good things about it too. For example, texting and driving will be less dangerous, drunk people will be able to drive home without worrying about crashing, or if there is a traffic jam, you don't have to worry, because the car will provide entertainment for you. It's the future now. Of course everyone wants to take things to the next level. I just don't think we're ready yet.

In conclusion. driverless cars are a bad idea because they'll cause more car crashes, make people lazier, cause many people to get car sick, including myself, and it'll do more bad than good. The car can help with many things as well . The future is bright, the next level of future things is driverless cars. But, for right now the future is doing just fine with drivers driving a car.",GPT4o,oKWdZB7QXEMEDgJvudU1,hs,Literary,"In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

101,"Growing up, watching shows that had futurisic characteristics, i have always dreamed of having a car that could drive its self. A car that would go the speedyou would tell it to go and let you sit back relax and let you enjoy yourself. Although i have always wanted one in the future,I realize that they are very dangerous and require a lot of cooperation at some times

The driverless cars could make a great impact on society if people started to obtain them. They use much less gas and not give off as much pollution. For example, the first paragraph states ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" But although i see the many pros that come with the driverless cars, i aslo see the cons. Paragrap seven states ""This means the juman driver must remain alert and be ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. The quote shows that although the cars are technically driverless, if they get in a complicated situation that they can not handle themselves, then the driver must be able to quickly react to change the situation. This would lead to lots of dangerous accidents. For example if the driver falls asleep and the car needs the humans help, the human may not be able to wake up in time befor the problem occurs. Also im guessing that the car would not have much time to alert the driver before a problem or accident occurs. One last thing that is bad about these cars are that if they get into an accident then the driver is fully responsible for them. Why should the non driver be blamed for the vars theat are suppose to be ""driverless.""

Driverless cars can bring many new things to us such as lower gas milage and less polution but overall, the driverless cars are not needed and can cause many problems. The car can get into accidents that humans are not responsible for and require a lot of human assistance which really would make the car ""driverless.""So if the problems could be fixed with the current condition of driverless cars then i would be happy to see them on the road, but until then I think it is much better to use the same cars that we have been using for years.",GNmFq87Z27WxbeW0BW6e,GPT4o,hs,Literary,"In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

First it give the percent on people and all they feel. They just have to do the math and look at all the muscles in there body. Then they will put it in the six different feelings. Then add it all up and which every one is the highest is what that person is feeling.

Keep reading to find out my reasons you should definetly join this program.

My first reason is being able to travel to all these different countries and knowing your helping someone in need. This program is to bring animals to countries that need these anamils to survive. We are needing extra help to save all these children and family's in need.

Have you ever thought of wakeing up to see the beautiful bright blue ocean with the the juicy red morning sky right outside on the deck, well you can do this everyday on these long trips. Any shift you are working you get nice things like if you work morning shift you get the beautiful sunrise. While you are working you get all these extra nice things, I'm sure you'll love it.

My third and final reason is, YOU AREN'T EVEN WORKING HALF THE TIME. On the way back ,witch is half the trip, you have no animals to deal with so no work. In the article the author stated, "" Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed."" There so many games you can play even while your on the boat, its a win win for you.

Let's do a recap on why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, my first reason was that you are helping the ones in need. Next I talked about the view you have always wanted when you wake up,it's great. Finally I talked about that half the time you aren't even working.

One reason I think you should be a seagoing cowboy is to help the nations by giving them more things they need such as food, animals, and more. I think helping the nations by doing this in the war will contribute to them so they could win if I give them the things they need to win the war.

Another reason I think people should join is to have fun. I say that because while you are at sea you could explore different places around the world. While being a seagoing cowboy, I visited places like Europe and China while i was working as a seagoing cowboy. I also went to Greece to see an Acropolis, and I even went to an excavated castle in Crete. When the animals are unloaded you could play many things such as Table-tennis, baseball, volleyball, and many more in the empty holds where the animals were.

109,"Have you ever wondered how you could make better choices? There are probably hundreds of ways to do so, but one way is more efficient. Seeking multiple opinions is a great way to make better choices. Seeking multiple opinions to make better choices can help because you get more knowledge if the problem comes up again, you have multiple ways to deal with that choice, and the person you talk to might have experience with what your dealing with.

Knowledge is always a good thing to have in tough situations. When you ask people their opinions on a choice, they give you knowledge on how to solve that choice. If the person your talking to gives you really good advice, and it works, you know the knowledge for next time. So now, when that choice comes around again, you know how to solve it.

Another good thing to have is multiple choices. If you ask multiple people for their opinion, you have lots of ways to deal with that choice. If one persons opinion didnt work, then you have other people ways to deal with the choice your trying to make. So, having multiple ways to deal with a choice is always a good thing.

Comparatively, there is another way to make a better choices. By asking someone who has dealt with the situation your in. For example, a therapist, a parent, or a friend could help you. The reason you want someone with experience with your choice is because they might know the best way to solve it. Thats why asking some with experience in your choice is always a great choice.

All in all, multiple opinions is always a good way to make better choices. Asking more people can get you tons of experience. Multiple choices are always good to have as well.

One way the F.A.C.S is valuable to a classroom is you can do more things in science contributed to emotions and human qualities. Even if you tried to fake your emotions in the classroom you couldn't. When you first start the process of detecting your emotions, it has to make a 3-D model of your face, and make sure all the mucles move like human muscles. According to the text, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.""

111,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling by just looking at their face? Now, scientist have discovered a new technology to read emotions. The new technology uses recognition of muscle movements in the face. This new technology would be valubale in a classroom with students because you could tell how the students really feeling, you could tell if they are faking emotions, and it could be a learning tool.

First, you could tell how the students are really feeling. In paragraph 9, the author states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This means if a teacher sees an upset student, the teacher can tell them to make a happy face and eventually the student won't be as upset. It would help everyone be happy because everyone will ""... unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

Second, it would help show if anyone is faking emotions. In paragraph 8, the author says ""...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This would also be helpful with students in a classroom because if student his trying a student is trying to hide being upset a teacher could know and then ask them whats wrong. Also, it would work the other way too. The teacher would know if a student would be faking being upset.

Lastly, it could be used as a learning tool. It could be a way of showing how facial muscles work and the emotions that are shown by them. In paragraph 6, the author states "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that it would be able to help students learn based off of their emotions.

There many things in the new technology that would be valuable in a classroom with students. For instance, it help tell how students are feeling. Also it could tell if a student is faking a smile and is really upset. Finally, it would be a helpful learning tool by changing lessons by the students emotions.

Well why not be both with our Seagoing Cowboys program. I did it and it chaged my life forever.

You can enjoy being the best of both worlds while helping others.

It may be dangerous, but so is everything else. People need us, but we need you to help us.

You may wonder why should I help people I don't know? here are some of the things I saw and did that you will be able to do too.

You can see many parts of the world like China or Europe.

Also you may see Acropolis in greece or take a gondola ride in Venice.

Maybe even Italy with sreets of water, or Creete with its Panama Canal.

Also if you are 18 or older this counts as military service, and when it comes down to it it's more safe to deliver suplies on a boat than be in the battle lines of war.

Plus You are helping people around the world by delivering important suplies like horses, young cows, and mules. Though you will have to feed alot of horses you'll be ok. I fed 335 horses and I was ok.

In concusion that is why you should be a seagoing cowboy. You will see parts of the world you never seen before, you'll be serving your country, and you will help people around the world.

The first thing im going to talk about is going to be the way they people look at this new technolgy. In the expert i saw that alot of people are starting to like this new technolgy and people are changing there mind about it. Another fact is a classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confuced or of task. i think that would be awesome for me becasue i have a hard time focosing in class.

The second thing im going to talk about would be what is the new techoligy about. Its new because you can see if a student is getting off task or hard to stay focussed. People like it because they will get help if they are confused and with out it the stuent wont ask and they ill just stay there confused the hole time and not know anything. I think that new tchonoly would be good for alot of students so i would reconmend it to alot of school across the USA.

Many people should like this for there kid. it will help them so much and make your kid a way better student. i think that technoley is super cool and reconmend it everywhere.

118,"Hundreds of teens each year die from texting,dinking, talking to passenger, while driving or even die somthing as simple as to paying attention. Driving is not for everyone.

Driverless car will prevent many accidents due to people mistake. Which are normal we make mistakes, But with the vechile watching our steps or even driving for us would be a benfit for that driver.

Google states ""google cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"". The cars aren't compeletly driverless; they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? your probably asking, although, the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires such as navigating through work zones and around accidents, until then they are free to text with a cell phone, call someone withour stoping. In this way, the driverless car is actually a safety feature.

How the car does this is with position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.

But the most important piece is the LIDAR(spinning sensor on the roof), it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. The combination of all is necessary for the driverless car to replicate the skill of a person at the wheel.

Even when the car require the driver aid, displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays.

Over all I see benfit in having driverless cars, They driverless cars allow us to complete as task such as putting on make up or text messaging someone, but they can still allow us to take over if needed. Which means that we do not put our live compeletly in the mercy of ours cars, but rather allow the car and the driver to work as together.",9bZWAhMiuXA6FtwF9J2N,GPT4o,ms,Literary,"In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

At certain schools around the world Students act bad and just act up in general at school, and teachers dont seem to do things about it. If kids played sports more the school would gain a good reputaion. Sports are always fun, more people need to get there gets in sports like how the schools wants them too

I believe that we should have all schools make kids certain sports, in certain times of the day. Like In elementary school you have gym after a class. We should tell parents that would want there kids to do activities that they would enjoy. If we had Students playing sports everyday then lots of people would be happy, plus who doesn't like to have fun once in awhile. If you wanna get on to the yearbook you need to be good in class and have good grades. If you do good things like help the teacher out they might take a picture and post you on there, saying something like ""This person helped me do something difficult"".

In order to be a student councilor, you need to understand others in a way that you can help them if they need it. Also you need to be a decent person and very understanding. Some kids may come if they need someone to talk to or are having trouble at home. As a student councilor you have very many responsabities such as caring and helping others when they need you.

My friend Don Reist invited me on a trip to Europe on a cattle boat in 1945, and that is when it all began. You should participate in the sea cowboys program because it is a great way to see sites, go traveling and make new friends. I have been to many different countries like Europe, Greece, China, Italy, and Crete! You could see these sites too if you join the sea cowboys program too.

It is also a very good way to make friends to. I have made friends with the people on the boats with me and the people i meet in different countries. Taking care of the animals was a great way for me to pass the time and helping my aunt Katie's farm made it alot easier. We arrived in Europe right after the pacific war.

If I could do that why do I need a computer to tell me that they are happy, sad and whatever else.

122,"I am going to be talking about how the use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Have you ever wondered how technolgy can sense how you are feeling? Well I am going to be explaining if I am for or against the value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions.

In the text the author says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."" Technology could also be very helpful for learning. The author says, ""A classroom computer could recognizd when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. He also says, ""Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" This technology could help sense if someone is in danger but they do not want to say that they are. In paragraph 5 in the text the author says, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. I do agree that technology would be valuable to read students emotional expressions.

Some students do not like explaining or expressing their feelings because maybe of what other kids might think of them or just because in general they may not know how too. In paragraph 4 the author states, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly).

I am for using techonology to read students emotional expressions. The technology could detect your emotions and help others also to know how you are feeling just incase of an emergency. The technology would be able to sense if you are in danger by your emotions. The technology would also help those students that are not opened up about their emotions and explaining or expressing their emotions.

In conclusion, I am for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. The technology is valuable because it can help students open up about their emotions rather than keeping all of their emotions inside and making their emotions worse by keeping them to themselves. Most students like talking and expressing their emotions so they will not have to deal with all of their emotions and that way they are relieved of stress about their emotions.",GPT4o,ZWSEnnh2DoddwIXz8TEi,hs,Literary,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

124,"I believe school summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects will help a student express their creativity, it will be less complicated, and it will let them learn about a topic they are interested in. If the project is student-designed, it is most likely for them to keep up with it and not set it aside. Students should be trusted to build something on what they learned on their own.

Even though not all students come up with astonishing ideas, all of them have the capacity to be creative. Creativity is important when it comes to projects. It helps a project look presentable, it also helps the audience gain interest. Students can let their imagination discover more ideas when a project is not teacher-designed because their options are not limited. Not only will it be more exciting to do a project, but it will increase students' grade by showing their creativity.

A student-designed project will relieve stress from students by being able to create whatever they please. Instead of having to assemble something difficult given by a teacher, a student will choose an easier option for themselves, so they will not build up pressure. Since they will most likely pick a non difficult idea, they can complete their project faster. Therefore, students will enjoy their summer break more.

Furthermore, most students will choose an option they are intrigued in, which makes a project become more interesting. Students will pick one out of a variety that they enjoy; they will stay on task. For example, the more engaged the students are to their project the more it will help them stay focused. When they pick a topic they like, the project becomes more simple to make because it is genuine or sincere.

Given all these points, summer projects should be designed by students. It will make it more easier for the students to work on and more interesting for the teacher to read. All of the students' creativity and engagement in the project can lead to positive outcomes. Students should enjoy their summer break while creating an incredible project they love.

Students that have anxiety, unease or any other forms of fear would truly benefit from attending classes at home.

The ability to be free and be in place where you are comfortable in, would only make you have more motivation to want to understand and learn that criteria.

Students would also benefit from being able to attend classes from home is that they do not have to get dress or do things to get ready for school.

is better to attends the classes in the school so a teacher can help students with anything students will need. teachers have the experience to explain students what they need to do about the class. attend classes online students basically are alone so is more confused to understand the class. in school if students get confused they can ask to someone else to understand. at home they dont have anybody so they have to think alot to understand. attend classes from home can affect students grades for less knowledge about the class unlike in the schools they have many opportunities to learn better.

By simply altering a lesson to fit a child's personality, the lesson could become more enjoyable and less challenging for the child.

Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" If Dr. Huang is in fact right about his technology's potential, children all over the world could become better educated. From my own personal experience I know that when the lesson deals with something I am less interested in I become bored, but if the lesson metions something I enjoy, then it becomes ten times easier.

Dr. Huang also says that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This is one of the most important lines in the article. By saying this, Dr. Huang opens up a world of oppurtunities for his technology. Many teachers around the world would agree that their students when talking, commuicate more with their emotions than physical words. These teachers would be able to know how their entire class was feeling as soon as they walked in. This would enhance the teacher's teaching style for the day ,and increase the students learning oppurtunity.

Dr. Huang's final arguement is also very important. He says when reffering to nonverbal human communications that, ""Computers need to understand that to."" Dr. Huang believes that computers must learn to read the human emotions, and I agree.

133,"I think driverless cars will be a good invention for the future. I don't think we will have to pass a driver's test to get to drive one. This will save time out of our days that we spend studying and practicing to pass those permits and tests. Although these cars aren't completely driverless yet, I believe we will get there soon and our progress on it is fascinating. ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents.""

Driverless cars have been thought of since around the late 1950's, it's just people or companies didnt have the technology, we have today, to make them. The cars also save money spent on gas and repairs. The article says, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.""

To conclude, yes I believe driverless cars are the way to the future. They will benefit us more than they will do harm, if any. Many companies have already started building their own edition of driverless cars. BMW have cars that steer, accelerate, and brake on their own, but even they sill need driver's assistance. And what about the driver's laws, will you have to be 18 to get one of these futuristic cars, or will there even be an age limit since the driver won't do anything?

136,"I think students should be able to use there phones at school just not in class . Like in Policy 1. Students should use there phones because if something happen at school they can call someone and get help. If students didn't get to use there phones in school and, something happened it would take to long for the student to go to the office. Also it would be nice to use your phone in school you can call your parents and tell them that your staying after school. One other reason they should let us use are phones is because the office get too crowed because people need to call home and parents and, sometimes people in the office tell you to get out because the office is to crowed sometimes you don't even get to call.

Also they should let students use there phones is that they would be happy to use there phones at school and like coming to school. Also teachers would be able to use is too so its good for the whole school and everybody will be happy. So i think the principal should change the rules and let us use are phones. Also so students don't use them in class teachers should collect the students phones before class starts and give it back when class is over so students will not use them in class or just turn them off and show the teacher.

Other reasons students should use there phones is because they can call somebody is an emergency happens. Also they can call 911 is something really bad happens. Another thing is they will enjoy coming to school and have a smile. I think people will enjoy the new rule if it changed and be happy to use there phones in school. So i hope the principal will change the rule and let us use are phones during school but not in the classrooms. I think other students will be happy to be able to use there phones during school.

other might think wow they changed the rule and be happy to use there phones during school. If the rule does change i think almost every students will be happy to use there phones.

137,"I think that driverless cars are good and bad. A car that navigates its own self, doesn't need a driver to take control of it, uses less fuel, and is controlled by a computer is most likely to be our future. We all want to do greater things, invent grather things, but we should also realize that some things can be thought of but not created. A driverless car has its ups and downs because if no human being is in control it could represent a bad aspect or a bad one. One good thing that comes to the top of my head is elderly people. This would be really useful to the elderly, especially because of muscle or bone aches. It reduces the number of crashes but could also influence them. The computer or whatever is controlling the car could misfunction or something could go wrong, therefore the car could end up crashing or causing an accident. Humans have the most control on a car. They decide the speed, direction, their surrondings. A computer could do thst too but not as acurate as a human would. Yes it is a very interesting thing thst could happen in the future but are we sure that we would want a machine to take over rather than a human. There are lots of arguements that can be done about this. Some people may agree, some people may not and thats fine because we all have different opinions.

Secondly, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of Cydonia for the first time all they saw was just a natural landform. One of my other reasons why is becasue we thought it was just a Martian mesa, witch are very common in Cydonia. My last reason is becasue with the 3D high-resolution images from NASA's MGS it shows that it was just a mesa.

140,"I think the Facial Coding System is valuable in a classroom. I think this because It can help out a lot. When a student doesn't want to explain thier emotions or don't know how to share emotions this system can be helpful and valuable. And I mean it is pretty cool that a facial system can calculate anyones emotions. And this FACS sounds totally unharmless.

In the article it explains how this system works. I will be wrtiting about how it works and get examples from the article. In the article it says that an action unit can calculate movement of one or more msucles and can detect the emotion. Dr. Paul, the creater of FACS states that he has calssified 6 different emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness all with the FACS. Examples of how the FACS can detect your emotion is in your face movements for example, as said in the story when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow when you are surprised; your orbicularis oris tightens your lips when you are angry. It is fantastic how this can know the emotion you are feeling.

I think FACS can actually be valuable in classrooms. A teacher can detect weither a student is happy,sad,angry, or surprised. It can be very useful for students that when they want to talk to thier teachers but don't know how to explain themelves this can help. FACS can help out in many more ways, useful ways. So my statement is this technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and I also think students would enjoy trying it out.",58BFgaAbQfILm6AveIYK,GPT4o,hs,Literary,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

As a NASA scientist I know that the face is just a natural landform not created by aliens.

Also if their where aliens, why would they make Face looks like an Egyptian Pharaoh? How would aliens even know about that? There is just no logic in these therioes, what so ever.

However NASA has evidence that this Face was no created by aliens but natural landforms. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveypr flew over Cydonia and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original picture taken by NASA's Viking 1 and 2 spacecrafts.

Of course everyone was not satisafied, believeing that alien markings were hidden by haze.

But mission controllers looked again, with some hard work, and only gained more facts that the natural landforms made more sense about how the Face got on Mars. Its turns out natural landforms are common around the American West. Also just another reason to have believed NASA is that the buget defenders wished there was an anicent civilization, so if there where Aliens dont you think NASA would have been making money off of the rumor if it were true.

148,"If we did a extracurricular activity everyday after school it could help us out a lot. Everyday after school each student should do a activity that gets their body moving instead of sitting down all day and not doing nothing. Some student's should try to do different activity's to meet new people and make new friends while other's just want to do it because it is fun.

I agree with doing at least one extracurricular activity after school. A lot of students do not like to go home after school because they do not want to be board all day because they have nothing to do at home. But when you do a after school activity you can have fun with your friends without a reason to be board. After school activity's can help keep you busy and out of trouble or it could help you bring your grades up if you are failing in one of your important classes that you are having trouble with learning in that class.

When extracurricular activity's pop up at your school you have to try it just for the fun that's in it. It may help you learn new games to share and play with your family and friends. When you are board at home you can just do the different activity's you learned at school such as Basketball, Soccer, computer games, or Building race cars and more to give you something to do when you are tired of playing on your phone or playing on your game system and you can not find anything else to do

151,"In ""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus,"" the author uses many details to suggest how venus is important to explore even though the risks are extremely high.

The first example of how the author proves that venus is worth exploring is in paragraph 4 the author states, ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" The author uses this quote from NASA in the article to show how even though they know its extremly risky, people are still trying to find solutions rather than leaving the problem.

The second example is in paragraph 7, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide has been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for 3 weeks in such conditions."" This example shows how the scientists are so curious in Venus that they simulating the harsh conditions to make strong technology to survive on Venus.

The third example is in paragraph 8, the author states ""Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author uses this example to summaraize that if we take the time and make the technology to explore Venus, then good things could come out of the solutions.

152,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""the author persents the topic on how the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it persents.

There are lots of thing to be leared about Venus so many things to elopre and discover. But there are aloso losts of dangers as well. For examlpe in the text it raeds,""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any of the planets in our solar system"", high heats in extermily dagerous thats one of the aine reasons Venus is hard to explore and have so many dificultys trying to learn more bout the plant its self. Another example as to why the study of Venus is difficault is its living coditions for examle in the text it states,""a thick atmosphereof almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blnkets Venus""this making it hard to even try to have a living thing on Venus. another exaple is in the text it states,""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atomophere""this adding on the the reasons as to why its difficult to even get close to evaluate data.

153,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author balances the pros and cons of exploring the planet Venus to boost the human race scientifically. The author expresses that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, making it realistic for life forms to inhabit the planet. That is, if they can handle the heat. The exploration of Venus is something modern scientists should engage in due to the potential technical advances the population can make because of the information on the living conditions the average biotic being would endure on Venus.

The knowledge scientists have the ability to gain from Venus can only bnefit us. Even the simplest efforts to explore the planet will leave us with more determination to continue exploring and feed us information crucial to the succession of the human race. Analyzing the atmosphere further can encourage adaptation and give us options of migration when our sun, inevitably, blows up. There being ""Many researchers... working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus,"" already proves the exploration to be something legitimate and worthwhile.

The risks being taken by choosing to explore Venus entertains the idea that the human race is diligent, curious, and selfless. The cause being fought for is for the benefit of future genertions of humans. With current and future technology, Venus' exploration will seem very realistic and encouraged by scientists with the same goals, giving the population a future.",GPT4o,zhSScLelJrXtVASccU7B,hs,Literary,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

154,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explaines all the dangers of Venus and how to over come them. He gives you good evidence on how you could explore our sister planet without suffering the harsh weather of Venus's surface. Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, and it may have even had large oceans long ago, but today Venus's surface is inhospitable for humans.

The author states that ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Venus is no longer Earth-like, its surface temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times the pressure we experiance on Earth. And with that, there are many other factors making Venus inhabitable for humans. The author did offer a solution to these dangers, which would allow the scientists to float above the dangers. NASA said they would take a ""...blimp-like vehical [that hovers] 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" It would make the conditions survivable for humans, but how much research could you do on the planet when you're 30 miles above the surface? The author goes on and writes that researchers are working on machines that could possibly go in the ground of Venus and collect data about the surface,and could return it to the scientists for them to study.

155,"In ""The Challenge of Exporing Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is sometimes called the "" Evening Star"" this is in paragraph 1 the first sentence. Sometimes referred as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus because Venus is sometimes right around the the corner-in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxixde blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the cloudds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and cloud have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.

157,"In my opinion I think its a good idea to have driverless cars because there would be less car accidents and the cars would change the world. They would use less fuel and they have more flexibility than a bus. The car announces the driver when he or she have to take over. The person in the car doesn't have to do all the work because the car helps them out. Also the car is not all driverless because you can have a turn in driving the car.

The driverless cars would be so much safer. Although they would be very expensive, but they would be worth it. They alert you for many things like pulling in or out of driveways, dealing with traffic, and navigating through complicated roads. The car also alerts you when there is a problem. The cars also has cameras to watch the driver if he or she is focused on the road. This is great because there would be a less possibility of anyone getting hurt.

These cars would make a big differnce in our world and thats why I think we should give them a try. They are so much safer for us and I know people would like them.

158,"In the United States, some public schools offer what is called ""distance learning"", a program where students remain at home and take classes online, as an alternative option to attenting classes in the school building. There are clear benefits to more schools allowing students to take classes from their homes. Sick students will not find their education hindered, anxious students will not be forced to endure a group setting, and others may find themselves more open to self-directed online lessons.

Firstly, it allows sick students to still take their classes, even while bedridden. In schools were students are required to be present in the classroom, sick students miss out on instruction and have to make up the work. Students who are enrolled in a distance learning program can continue to learn, even if they are unable to leave home. Distance learning can also have other benefits in the realm of health.

In terms of mental health, students who suffer from severe social anxiety and have issues being around others would perfer an in-home learning experience. These students often find themselves unable to cope in the group setting of a school classroom, and unable to learn. The online courses or video conferencing of distance learning would allow these students to participate in school without risking a panic attack.

Another benefit is allowing students a self-paced style of learning. The rigid structure and pacing of the classroom could be a ""turn-off"" for some students; distanced learning, at least in online classes if not video conferencing, offers a more relaxed and self-directed style. The student determines when they do the work, when they study new content, and for how long they work, with the only strict condition being the deadline when they have to turn it all in. Students enrolled in a self-directed online course may find themselves more engaged than if they were in a classroom.

Distance learning is something all schools should implement. It would allow sick students to continue learning, allow anxious students the opportunity to learn while remaining in a safe environment, and provide a more engaging style of learning for others.",GPT4o,WAwKUYhl4cm8pdZSBc5U,hs,Persuasive,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

object . Also using heads up displays when your driving like some thing are not available like trying to text and call someone on the phone.

The driverless car is a great idea beacuse the car tells you when you should break. Reason why this is a good ideas it can steer for you what if it really slippery out and you have no controll the sensor will help you keep calm of the car. The sensor tell you when you should go fast and slow down. this may reduce the amount of car crashes.

The senor that vibrate when you are driving is a well thought process because is your driving of the rode your seat will virbate telling you your off the road. also it tells you when you need to get back in your lane when you are driving. this will reduce car crashes because it helps indacte where you are driving.

They are predicting that this technology will be able to tell wheter or not a kid is confused or bored class. This could be good because the teacher might be willing to make up new and improved lessons intsead of the same boring old thing.

The reason I am against the Facial Action Coding System is becuase not everyone should be able to know what I am feeling. My facial expressions might show that I am upset over something so drastic but, its really i didn't get any pasta for dinner last night. Your expressions can read into to much. Then what, what are you suppose to when you find out everyone in your class either bored or upset you cant talk to everyone about their emotions not most people would want to open up, Which is understandable because you didnt come to school to have your teacher read your facial expression and start to anaylze everything about you.

It is a technology that Dr. Paul Eckman created he has classified six basic emotions on it. scuh as (happyiness,suprise,anger,disguts,fear,and sadness.) what this technology does is show the emotions that universal. the new emotion recongnition software tracks the facial movements.

Now I will be arguing weather the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I think this is a bad idea for the technology emotional thing to be in class room to read students emotion becuase if a student is upset for a reason and the emotional mechine read there feeling maybe the student didnt wanna tell there personal binusness about there feelings. I also think its a bad idea because what if the technology mechine tell you your feeling a suertion way but then the mechine got it wrong, then the teacher would be naging that person on about there mood.

164,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", I learned thet computers can now feel what emotions that you are feeling. This is a really cool thing cause now we can see and know when someone is actually happy or not. We could have so much more uses for this then trying to guess what emotions someone is feeling.

I think that this type of technology is actually very useful, my reasons for that come from the article when the author tells about how using a special camera can detect when someone is becoming bored when doing homeowrk or doing someother type of school work on the computer. If you can tell when comeone is confused or bored then you could really get some help or get a better, more fun filled math questions. Than would make students more productive and want to actually learn rather then when you are bored and doing ISTEP, they can make the test more exciting.

But there could also be some down fall to it. When a computer is watching your while your on it then that could be really weird feeling for some people. Also when a computer is seeing your facial expression all the time you could just be talking to someone and the computer would think your not getting what ever your doing so then it would have a tutor come up when you dont even need one.

So in my conclusion I think that these emotion reading computer cameras could not be so good but in other cases could be really handy or even in some events save you from getting a bad grade on a test. But in all I do believe that if these were to come into our schools I would just hope one thing, and that is to be graduated befor that time comes.",6iUyrMktXzdXD1c8Xtty,GPT4o,hs,Literary,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

whether it's a natural landform or a alien artifact. Many believed alien markings were hidden by haze. While others believed it was a natural landform based on evidence. Scientists have alot of evidence that the human face rock is just a landform. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size"" meaning if there was any type of alien life form on Mars then the digital images would show some type of evidence of it.

Instead, scientists just keep finding evidence and taking pictures that points everything about the human faced rock back to a natural landform.

In regards to that the picture actually shows the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa. Trying to convince someone to believe what scientists say i wold bring out alot of information about the human faced rock showing it's just a landform by telling that person scientists figured it was just a martain mesa, common around

Cydonia. Many say the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.

With many saying NASA would rather hide conspiracy theories, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization. Althougth few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact photographing cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived on the Red planet.

178,"Is Studying Venus a worthy pursuit?

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents; although, venus is very dangerous, Venus is known that it could of once been just like Earth. Even though its known that it could been just like Earth many years ago scientist still dont have enough evidence to proof that it was just like Earth many years ago.

Venus is often refered as Earth's ""twin"" because Venus is the closest planet to earth in density and size. If its like earth in many ways why is it so dangerous? Venus is the hottest planet out there; although Mercury is the clostes to the sun venus is still the hottset plantet in our solar system. Venus temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit. These condition are very extreme that no human could live there if they wanted too.

""if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface?"", scientists or Astronomers are fascinated by venus because its the most earth-like planet in the solor system. Venus has rocky sediments on its surface and also has familar featrues such as vallys, craters, and mountians.

futhermore, NASA has been thinking of ways to figure out how we could get on Venus and maybe live there in the futrue. If NASA didnt think it was a good idea they wouldn't have kept trying to find ways to get there with no harm to the equitment or anything living. For example, NASA has been making simplified electronics made out of silicon carbide and has gone far enough to test them in venus like conditions to see posible ways to getting there safe.

In conclusion, Venus is very dangerous but it is worthy enough to try to study.

The most important reason why I beleive that items that appear to be offensive should not be removed from library shelves is because people should be able to read, listen, or watch watever they want to. Anybody is entitled to his or her own preference. Some people prefer @CAPS1 rated movies or music with explicit content. If that's what people are interensted in then so be it. Anybody should not have to stop renting something that they want just because someone else doesn't want them to.     Furthermore, if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in his or her house then just don't get it. Noone is forcing anyone to listen to or watch something that they don't want. It is actually a very simple matter. It's a choice whether someone wants to watch or listen to what they want, and they don't really have the right to be able to tell someone else that they can't watch or listen to what they want. If someone doesn't perfer something then they don't have to get it.     Finally, just because something seems offesnsive doesn't mean that it still isn't enjoyable. The @CAPS5 example that I can think of is a movie that is @CAPS1 rated. Just because a movie is rated @CAPS1 doesn't mean that it still doesn't have a good story or moral to it. Their are plenty of rated @CAPS1 movies that have won @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and plenty of other rewards. Another example is the singer @ORGANIZATION1. While his music @MONTH1 be offensive, their are still many people that enjoy it. Certain things that offend people can be enjoyed by other people.     In conclusion, noone has the right to be able to stop anyone from renting what they want from a library. People just really need to mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are only offensive if certain people beleive that they are.

184,"It's common that some students don't want to stay after school, other students could have other events to attend to, and that can get in the way of students education.

If schools are already making it stressful for students think about how it might impact on their mental health and grades, fewer students might not have interest about the programs that the schools are suggesting, this could also get in the way of spending time with your family, and that could increase major mental health issues to the students in the future.

It's normal if students don't like staying after school, but if schools are forcing students to do something that they don't want to do, that could develop a students safety and they might not want to go to school anymore.

Maybe staying after school could help increase students self-confidence, make new friends, or increase their mental health.

It's always best to give students options, and letting them enjoy what they do best at, but it's not right to force them into doing what they don't want to do; yes I agree that after school activities should be in school, and open to all students.

Don't force students into something they don't feel comfortable with, but recommend it to them so they can think about it.

Mrs. Principal,

In my opinion, you should allow students to have their phones in school and let them use these devices during free time.

From experience, I don't like having my phone with me during class.

If your mind is thinking about someone texting you back, it interferes with what the teacher is saying.

And if you constantly wonder if you left it on high or vibrate, your mind is wandering, and you can't utilize your resources to their full potential (by resources I mean teachers and other students.)

But also, I believe that students should be able to have their phones available whenever they feel they need them.

For example, let's say I have basketball after school, and my mom thinks that I don't.

I should have a way to communicate to her that I need her to pick me up at 5:30, not 3:20.

Besides, this method is more efficient than calling in the middle of class, on the school's phone, wasting your class's time and your time.

Texting someone while doing your locker combination is easier than taking the time out of the already short 90 minutes designated for class.

Thank you for considering this.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",5qkhu2Xacg2OFr8Csu1n,GPT4o,ms,Persuasive,"Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. She is considering two possible policies:

This leads me to a story about an incident in which I had to make a difficult decision that not only affected me, but also the people closest to me.  At the age of 16 I encountered a dilemma in which I was given two amazing ‘opportunities simultaneously, however the issue was that I could only choose one. I had a decision to make, and although it was not the most life threatening decision there is to make at the time it felt this way. My piano recital and my aunt's wedding took place on the same afternoon at 1:00, and I had a disastrous time attempting to figure out which event I was to attend. Both events were important to me, and I had no idea as to how I was going to make the decision, but I spent three weeks thinking about the benefits of attending one and not the other. At this time I had been playing piano for ten years, and it was a tradition for me the close the recital every year, so I felt that it would be devastating not only to me, but to my teacher if I were to choose to attend my aunt's wedding instead of the recital. On the other hand, family is the most valuable thing to me, and I would never imagine missing my aunt's special day. In my head this decision was unbearable because I had to choose between two important memories- it was either my most devoted hobby or the most important day of my aunt's life.  Three weeks had passed, and the time had come when I had to make a decision. ‘Over the past three weeks I had written down every pro and con there was with regard to attending the recital. In addition to this Ihad also written down every pro and con there was with regard to attending the wedding. I sat down by myself and thought about how I would feel if I were to choose my recital instead of the wedding, just as I sat and thought about how I would feel if I were to choose the wedding over the recital.

188,"Lots of people think the face on Mars is an alien or something else,its really not. The face on Mars is not an alien because there is no proof of it being an alien. Only few people have said it looked like an alien,but they have no proof of that being true. Lots of scientist and NASA have proof that its not an alien and that it is something else thats there. People who think that the face is an alien, they are wrong.

The face on Mars is not an alien because NASA said it was a sort of rock formation. Also that it looked like a human head. NASA never said it looked like an alien or that they had proof of it being an alien. NASA said ""NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth"". NASA also gave proof that the shadows gave an illusion of the rock formation that it looked like a face.

Another way that it did not look like a face is that MOC said it was just a landform on Mars. MOC also said that the face was not and alien and revealed what it actually was. MOC said "" MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos...anxious web sufers were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site,revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"". MOC had proof and a picture that the face was not an alien and that it was something diffrent.

Finally, you can see that most of the scientist said it was a type of landform or something else. They never said that is was an alien. They all had proof and a picture to tell us that it was a natrual landform. The face is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a type of landform. The face on Mars is not an alien at all.",GPT4o,h5eI8uU9e6oenJG6ylwq,ms,Literary,"You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

193,Many great talented sports players have grade c average at school and maybe cant get higher grades. Why not give students who are passing a chance to play its a passing grade and many students can only get that. What if it means that you could win the championship and the best decision of your life. Its really not fair to students that try so hard for good grades we need many students participating in a school activity maybe it'll boost their grades up because they will love it. And getting them involved in sports could keep their mind off of bad things and will have fun doing what they like. And when the policy is b average grade how are you going to let kids enjoy themselves playing sports. Maybe you should have a B average in school but when you do give that restriction your just not helping the cause of kids who want to play. So many kids are willing to change just to represent their school but you don't give them an opportunity with a restriction like that. Maybe some ideas or thoughts of how you can help them or what you can do to make sure he goes up in a grade and really be able to play with a b grade. So now kids will get an opportunity to stay on track and to play for their school and to be smarter students.

194,"Many students have expressed that projects should not be given over summer break. Students feel they should not have to do work during their summer break, Just as much as teachers shouldnt not have to grade papers over their summer break, If summer projects must be assigned they should be student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because the students would know how to complete the assignment, they would also find more interest, and more then likely the project would be completed with effort.

Over the summer most students are sent home with no instruction or contact availability. Students would attempt to do the assignment with no teacher guidance or help from others. With out the proper help the project could be completed wrong and completed with out any effort. When attempting to do my own summer project I stumbled into a problem and had no way to correct the problem, If summer projects were student made there are no excuses for not understanding how to complete the work.

Every student has a least favorite class, many would complain about a summer project from a boring or hard class. More students are likely to complete something that is more appealing to them personally. For example art is a more appealing subject to one, while someone else could be interested in history. Making your own project could be more intriguing which will make someone want to actually do the assignment they have created.

Majority of high school student do not complete their summer project. When a student completes the work it is more for the grade then personal gain. With the option to have students create their own projects brings creativity, interest, and effort. Many individuals put more effort into their own creations like art, putting more effort will cause more learning for the students personal gain, and the projects would be done nicely.

Many schools require summer projects to be completed. These projects would be more beneficial if students were able to create their own assignment. The idea of student designed projects are more beneficial because students would know how to complete the work, they would find more interest, and the project would be completed with more effort put into it. ",AkdbLObPSBIpejLkOB6I,GPT4o,hs,Persuasive,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

195,"Many schools are starting to offer online schooling for students. Students or teachers may believe this can be a very beneficial program. However, I believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student. Students some times need an actual teacher showing or explaining to them face to face content, others take extra-curricular activities, and many students may even forget they have an online class.

First, not every student can learn by just one explanation, many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something. Take for example my cousin, She's taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesn't understand the explanation they are giving her. Her struggles with the material is there because she doesn't have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that. Not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website. Many students need that extra help, whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation.

Secondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher.

Lastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.

In conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students. Many need a teacher to show them face to face content, some take extra-curricular activities, and majority of the students forget they even have an online class. For those few reasons is why online schooling shouldn't be an option to students. ",GPT4o,m4J0F1dlL5fDySsezOUE,hs,Persuasive,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

196,"Mona Lisa is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. There is many theories of Mona Lisa being sad, or feeling many other emontion but no body knows the truth but Da Vinci.

Based on the text evidence,

"" Making Mona Liza Smile,""

a new software called Facial Action Coding System has been developed to try infenitfing Mona Lisa's facial expressions. She could have up to six different basic emontions.

First of all, Mona Lisa overall expressions use she is 83% happy.

Based on this article, "" the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). each expression is compared against neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This is saying that even that she shows no expressions, she is certainly happy but might be having mix feelings as well.

Another reason Mona Lisa can be feeling disgusted, fearful, or even angry but yet she's very mysterious. In the text it says, "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.""

If humans have trouble figuring out if something is feeling happy or sad, how can a software be able to do such thing.

The software FACS is interesting becuase it's able to know your emotions with any movement you do. For example, in the text it says, "" even though individuals often show varying degress of expressions. Using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks thsee facial movements."" If a gental move can determine an emotion, this software will have a challenge on finding out Mona Lisa's emotions because it's just a painting.

Therefore, Mona Lisa will be mysterious until the software identifies her emotions. Mona Lisa is and will always be a unique peice of art.",GNmFq87Z27WxbeW0BW6e,GPT4o,hs,Literary,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

198,"Most of us know how far we have reach with modern technology, defitnetly far. Due to this is not that surprising that nowadays computers are able to recognize people's emotions through this new software. Where is technology taking us?

It all starts by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a system that basically makes computers identify the movement of human muscles in the face that show different human emotions. This lets computers know if you are either sad or happy, uninterested or bored, etc. So now what? Computers are being able to comprehend our emotions, interact and even understand us? As crazy as it sounds, it can actually work in a good way.

How can a software on a computer actually benefit us, and indeed work in our way, especially if you are a student? Well, this makes computers able to understand student's feelings towards an assingment. It will indentify students emotions and help them benefit by trying to work with them. As Dr. Huang (1 of the innovators of this software) states on the passage on paragraph 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This could help students by trying to make the work easier for them, making it more interesting, or making it easier by a change of words we'll understand better. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effetive human instructor"". Basically like a teacher, but the ""teacher"" is really the computer that helps you understand the content better by your facial expressions or emotions in regards to the work or assingment you are taking.

In this era where technology is such a big thing, we can expect a lot of things, even computers being able to comprehend our emotions and make something out of it. Whether it is telling us if the Mona Lisa was really happy or not, make us have more interest on an assingment or make a videogame better, all those things add a value to this software which can be a helpful thing in the future.",AkdbLObPSBIpejLkOB6I,GPT4o,hs,Literary,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

199,"My Principal has decided that every student must do an extracirricular activity in school. Most people disagree with this statement but I think otherwise. I agree with my principal because it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.

There are many students that sit inside, and dont go outside as much as the are supposed to. I believe if our students are doing an extracirricular activity, it can be a great opportunity for them to make new friends and be more social. there are some students that struggle to find the courage to get up and find new friends, but if we have students doing sports, or as little as working on the yearbook once a week, it could have a big impact on those students social lives.

another good reason to have everyone do an extracirricular activity at school is it is very healthy for your mental and physical health. . All the exercise in fooball is physical, working your legs and arms to burn off fat and build muscle. But you can also improve your confidence and determination.

Finally we have extracirricular activities acting as a great outlet for kids who have family problems and/or are bullied. Most kids who have big problems dont like to open up about them because they feel like they'll be judged or made fun of, but if they are on an engaging sports team, or are working on the yearbook they could have someone to speak with that they trust, or just something to get their mind off of their personal problems.

I hope this helped you get another perspective on how extracirricular activities could help our school. it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.",GPT4o,kSMnudXIOM5ygYWyRxdh,ms,Persuasive,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

202,"My view on changing school policies is that it may not be such a good suggestion. Maybe the principle should think that twice before actually changing it into a school policy.

My belief is that a lot of kids get lazy and don't do the work. I think that if the principle would just let them know she's thinking about this policy a lot of kids in these sports activities would get to work and try way harder in school.

So I am against this policy because this could affect many kids or young adults in their future career. Some teachers may not think so but just go head and ask the coaches or the teachers who organize these activities. Ask them and just here to what they'll tell you. They may tell you that they know that a lot of there students are capable of getting a B or higher. I hope This really changes the principles mind.

206,"One summer afternoon, a boy named Generic_Name asked his mom if he could go to the park. She agreed, but told him not to stay out too late. Generic_Name informed his dad about going out and he said to travel with a few of his friends, due to kidnappings in the area he didn't want Generic_Name to be alone at the park. Generic_Name also told his older brother about him leaving the house for a bit and he said to watch the area for anything suspicious and that if he did see something, that Generic_Name and his friends should head home immediately. Thanks to his family, Generic_Name and his friends got home safe and sound. Listening to multiple opinions can help people make safer and smarter decisions.

The first example is that multiple opinions can help you make safer choices. Like with Generic_Name, going out with people you know is a great way to stay safe. Doing things in broad daylight helps as well. Unfortunately many kidnappings and random shootings are happening presently. Following all of this advice could help a simple walk to the corner store just that much safer.

Secondly, taking in multiple opinions help people make smarter decisions too. Referring back to the introduction when Generic_Name's brother told him to survey the area and watch for any strange activity was an amazing idea. Watching for people that are acting out of the ordinary is a helpful tip, because if that person were to do something weird knowing who exactly it is your getting away from is a good thing. You also always want to know where you are at all times. It's also important to know where every exit and entrance available in any public setting.

In summary, listening to the advice of multiple people is a way to stay safe and make educated decisions. If Generic_Name were to just leave the house without speaking to his dad or brother, who knows what could have happened. The safety of you and your peers is a major priority. Everyone should get a second opinion on as many things as possible. ",GPT4o,ZTV0ibEebYZIrlsYcCdY,ms,Persuasive,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

208,"Our principal has decided that all of us students must take at least one extracurricular activity. While other students may disagree with this rule I strongly agree with this new decision. This new rule can help students later on with life skills or just finding their passion. The new rule can also help the school with task such as making the yearbook and making sales.

My first reason I agree with this decision is that students can use the skills from their classes later on. If you take a language class it can help with communication to other people that dont speak English. If you want to work on computers when you get older taking a computer class can help. Using skills from the classes you take can help later for jobs when you are no longer in school.

My second reason I agree with this decision is that taking these extracurricular classes can help a student discover a new hobby of theirs. At first you may not like your new extracurricular class but later on the class may become fun to do and maybe even your favorite class. I know this because I used to hate programming in computer class but now I find it very fun to do!

My third and final reason I agree with this decision is that it can help the school. If the school doesn't have a yearbook team the teachers have to make it together and that can take forever. With a team of yearbook students they can interview people for quotes, surveys for the yearbook, and make it look better overall. Another activity is sports and with sports you can do sales and make extra money for the school by selling tickets for games and food. Without a school sports team some fund raising money would be lost for things the school needs like new equipment or supplies for students.",GPT4o,otbF9ZBRF5DOUUwGQA8D,ms,Persuasive,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Venus is the closest plant to earth in terms of density, size, and in distance. Earth, Mars, and Venus all are planetary neighbors. Something Earth is closter to Mars or we are closer to Venus, it just depends on the different speed. Venus is sometimes around the corner, in space terms. We, humans, have sent plenty of spacecrafts to land on cloud-draped world. But none of the spacecrafts have survived the landing less than a day. We havent had a single spaceship land down on Venus in more three decades.

Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon diocide covers it. The clouds are th echallenging part because of te sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The temperature is an average of about over 800 dergrees in Fahrenheit. The atmospheric presurre is 90 times greater that what we experince here on Earth. This conditiond are very extreme for us humans can encounter on earth. It also hads the hottest surface of temperture than any plant in our solar system. The geology and weather shows us erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and constant lightning that strikes to the land of the surface. Venus is a very Earth-like plant in our solar system. It is covered with largely oceance and that could suppoort different forms of life, like our plant. It has a very rocky sediment which includes features such as valleys mountians, and craters.

Venus has a lot of value. We should go out into the solar system and not be scare dof their dangers.

212,"People make many facial expressions to tell how they are feeling about certain people or situations. There really a need for a software to detect how a students emotional expressions are? Classrooms do not need technology for syudent to tell what their emotional expressions are. Students peers are more than captiable of telling weather the person likes something or not. It's also a waste of techonolgy to be put in a classroom.

One reason why technology to read students is not benetfical is facial expressions can be seen and dosen'r have to be heard. In the passage pargraph four it states that, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are univeral and individuals often show varying dgrees of expressions."" Another reason is humans are the detecters of weather another persons like something or not. In paragraph five it states that, ""In fact, we humans perform this same ""calculation"" everyday. For instance you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Why need technology when people have their ouwn knowledge of whats going on with a person. Last reason is using your muscles called palpabraeus, in paragraph eight it explains that using your muscles you can spot certain faces a person is trying to make. It says, ""To an expert faces dont lie; these muscles clues are used to spot when a smile politician or celebirty isn't being truthful.""

In conclusion using technology is not a good use to read student in a classroom. There no reason because there are people when can detect other people's expressions.

213,"People often ask multiple people for advice and opinions and think it's a better choice, why though you ask?

I'll tell you my reasons why.

People mostly ask more than one person for advice so that they can ask the next person for good advice if the other person didn't have any, you can take one person's advice and ask another person if it's good or not, and they can use advice that's commonly used.

First off, people ask the next person for advice because if one person doesn't have good advice or just didn't have any, they can move on to the next person who does. If someone doesn't tell them advice, they don't think of just standing there, doing nothing, because of one person that didn't tell them anything. They tell another person, and another person, and ask as many close people as they can for advice.

Secondly, if you asked someone for advice, you can take what that person said and ask if other people say if it's good advice or not. People do this to test if they can trust another person or not. They tell what they said to a trustworthy companion and say if it's good enough opinion that should be taken, or poor advice that shouldn't be taken. If it's good they're trustworthy, and if it isn't they're not trustworthy. Being trustworthy is essential for asking for advice since you can take it knowing they're not lying.

Thirdly, if someone asks a lot of people for advice and they say the same thing, they shoud take that advice since it's commonly used, which is a good thing. It's a good thing because why would a lot of people be taking the same advice if it's bad? So, it has to be great advice. It also depends on how much they trust that person or not, but if they do trust that person, then they should take that advice seriously.

People ask multiple people for advice because they can ask more close friends if one person didn't tell them anything, they can compare that persons advice to other people and see if it's good or not, and they can use advice that's mostly used. Those are my reasons why seeking multiple people for advice and opinions are a better choice.",EIRXvYWppqbZbWdEv1bJ,GPT4o,ms,Persuasive,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Therefore if it was forced it would defiantly not be as much fun because you wouldn't want to do it. Nobody should be forced to do something if they don't want to.

216,"Seagoing Cowboys program is a once in a life time oppertunity. You get to be with animals, get to ride in a boat, and also get to see many archetectial designs, such as the Great Wall of China or the Eiffel Tower. If you ever get the chance to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program, I suggest that you do.

Seagoing Cowboys lets you stay with animals when you ride in the boat. When I was working, I got to work with animals such as horses and cattle. There are many animals to work with. There are also many things that you must do for the animals. You must feed them, water them, and clean out their stalls. The animals usually eat oats or wheat. Animals can be hard work, but they can also give you something fun to do.

Seagoing Cowboys program is all by sea. You pick up the animals on land and then, you set sail and hit the water. If you have never ridden in a boat, then I suggest that you take this oppertunity in life. Boats can be very fun. They rock back and forth like a rocking chair and float on water. Boats are proably the most important thing that we need for the journey. If we did not have the boats, then we are out of luck.

If you have never seen any national landmark, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to try to see a landmark. On the trips I have taken, I have gotten to see the Acropolis, parts of China, and have done and seen many other things. One of my favorites was riding in a gondola, in the city of water, Venice. The landmarks are important because they remind us of friendship. For example, France gave us the Effiel Tower to us as a peace treaty? Well, now you know.

The Seagoing Cowboy program lets you be with animals, get to ride on a boat, and gives you the oppertunity to see national landmarks like the Great Wall of China.

217,"Seeking multiple opinions on a topic can help somone make a better choice because, the person gets different points of veiw. Asking for advice by multiple sources can help the person become aware of possible bias or non-bias answers, which they may encounter if they only ask one person. For example, say you need advice on whether or not to get a dog or a cat as a pet. What would happen if you did seek advice? What would happen if you didn't? What kind of opinions would you become aware of?

You are unsure whether a dog or cat is a right pet for you. You decide to ask the advice from multiple others by different sources. One person you ask is completely against dogs; this person is being biased as they are telling you how they believe cats are better than dogs, only because they have one. They list the negative qualities of dogs, and list the positive qualities of cats, something you consider.

The same thing in the above paragraph happens with a dog lover, who advises you get a dog, which in their opinion, is better than a cat. This person has a dog, and is being biased aswell. This enables you to get different opinions on your question by seeing both sides of the story. The dog lover, like the cat lover, now tells you the negative qualities of cats, then the positive qualities of dogs. You can now make a better choice on which pet to get that suits you.

Now, say you didn't ask for any other opinion and decide to get a dog. Since you didn't seek out others advice, you find that this dog needs too much exercise, is always hungry, and doesn't leave you alone. You are unhappy with your choice since you didn't seek out all the possible information from others.

219,"Should students be forced to take an extracurricular activity? I don't take they should for many reasons. Taking extracurricular activities can increase work and responsibility, take time away from more important areas, or even cause stress. A student should only take an extracurricular activity if they know that they'll enjoy it. Otherwise, it can negatively affect the student in many ways.

Taking an extracurricular activity means more work, and considering the amount of work students already have, it can be overwhelming. Many students won't be able to complete all their assignments because of the extra activity. This can lead to lower grades and worst performance in other classes. Not only will students have more work, they will also have to manage their time in order to be able to consistently participate or show up for that activity.

You might be thinking that time management is a good skill to practice, in which you're not wrong, but it can also mean taking time away from other things in order to include something else. When students take extracurricular activities, they take away from their free time in order to put it in their schedule. Students use their free time to do their homework, relax from work, or spend with their family. This is pretty important for a student, considering that this may stress them out. This leads into our final reason.

The increased amount of work and responsibility, combined with managing time efficiently, can be enough to overwhelm student to the point where they get stressed. Students might not be able to keep up with all the work they get from their extracurricular activity plus all their other classes. As stated before, this can lower grades, and force students to take time away from those classes just to focus on their extracurricular activity. Stress is very serious problem already, and it can be beneficial not to force a student to participate in an activity that they don't want to do.

In conclusion, taking an extracurricular activity can have negative affects. It starts with unnecessary work, which leads to taking time away from other things, which finally leads to stress. Many students already do extracurricular activities, mainly because they enjoy it. But some students need time to focus on other things they might find more important, which isn't a bad thing. Students shouldn't be forced to join an activity, but they should always have the option to.",AXeY7ER93kUbnN60gZMG,GPT4o,ms,Persuasive,"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

220,"Some people say that students are better off attending classes online, mostly because they can feel a sense of comfort and no worries of school tardiness. I say that it's better to not attend distant classes and attend them from the school itself.

Students are better off attending classes from the actual school because students tend to have more concentration while actually attending the class. When attending the class from home, students will be more concentrated on their home atmosphere, or what happens at home. Concentrating onto something usually comes from the atmosphere you are in. Attend your classes are better and more effective when the person is alerted or more attentive to their classes or courses.

Moreover, students will develop social communication when interacting with other students. Social communication is important because not only will you get to know the other person's side of knowledge, but you can get experience from the other person that could benefit or impact your way of making desicions in your life. Students will be more of an introvert if attend classes from home or distant classes. In this way, students will definitely develop working skills when they start having a job as an older person.

However, even if they won't be able to go through or worry about tardiness if taking distant classes, going to school knowing that there is tardiness, will prepare them for the future when running to work and making it on time. Making to school or work on time depends on how the individual is smart enough to manage their own time wisely.

In conclusion, the more preferable method for students is coming to school or the class session wherever it's taking place. In this way, students develop better communication, better concentration and develop time management. Students will become better individuals. ",GPT4o,fpe6BEUXauTpaW54eVhY,hs,Persuasive,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

Students may benefit from attending classes at home in the way, that some students may work better and or harder if they are working alone and one on one. There are students that know what they are doing and can figure it out on there own, but other students may not be able to. I do agree that the online classes may help some students, and some students may succeed in the classes.

Other students may not benefit from attending classes at home, some students may work better if they are with a teacher. There are many students that understand the material better if a teacher explains it to them one on one, or in a class. Students may find it easier to learn hands on, and have a teacher explain, and show them, and help the students understand the material.

Schools should offer classes that can be attend at home, because students can benefit from the classes taken at home.

223,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This helps them to keep their brain running. I believe that the students should get to design what project they want to do. Choosing their project will guarantee that they are focused while working on it, they will choose a topic that interests them, and their grade will result at a higher score.

Allowing students to choose their projects will help keep them focused on it. For example, if a student likes things related to writing, they will enjoy working on it. They will give it all their effort and time. It also allows them to focus more on the topic itself. Being home will let also let them be comfortable working on their projects. They will not be distracted by any classmates. They will feel less pressured by their teachers to get things done. They will be able to pace themselves. And their hard work will be reflected in their projects.

Students tend to get exited about a topic they are interested in. Giving them the freedom to do so will result in a better researched project. They will also be interested in similar things, so they will continue to research without them being told to do so. The quality of their project will be reflected by their interest in the topic they choose.

Some people may believe that getting their research project assigned by a teacher is better. I disagree with this statement. Students will feel the pressure of getting the assignment done because a teacher told them to do so. Some may even do the project last minute because they were not interested in the topic. Or maybe they were not comfortable working on it. Their efforts to work on the project will be decreased, resulting in a much lower grade. If a student chooses the topic they want to work on, and the time they dedicate to working on it, they will get a higher score. It will assure that the students continue to learn during their break.

In conclusion, a student-designed project will ensure they continue to learn over the break. They will get to enjoy their break and learn at the same time.

There is an ongoing debate that students should take online classes rather than being in school. Those who disagree state students should go to school because they will meet new people and it would improve their social skills but this is not true. Although some may disagree it would be more beneficial for students to participate in online classes.

They are various reasons why students should participate in online classes. Students would have less behavior problems because, they are not around other students to cause problems. Also, it would be more likely for students to pay attention if they don't have as many distractions that being in school causes. Students would be in their houses so, it would be easier for them to stay focus and stop them from causing disruptions.

They are further reasons why students should participate in online classes. Student's are in school for hours they will focus better if they are in a more comfortable environment. Maybe some students are introverts, being in school causes stress and pushes students to do things they don't want. Student's are more likely to participate if they are under less stress.

225,"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier.

Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house.

Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time.

Some students just do it to finish high school earlier, they have the opportunity on taking classes online during the summer and be able to get less classes on their senior year or just graduate earlier if they taking the standard diploma, that is a smart thing to do if you are planing on go to college and finish your carrier on a young age, and start working at young age too.

On my opinion I think that having that opportunity is a good thing and a bad thing because going to school is the best decision that you can make on your life, you get to make friends and get to know a lot of people during all the time you spend at school, but not everyone have that opportunity, thats why this opportunity that the school is giving you is unique and can help you a lot, the only thing you need is a computer or a electronic device that can get access to the internet.",GPT4o,Pk6zgcaEVhK9EEixEngf,hs,Persuasive,Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

Being at home can get distracted and it is not the same in school to receive classes with a teacher who can help and have the attention of students for better explanations. As the video conferencing does not develop social and how speak with smartness.

First at all, online does not benefit students to the education and the culture to learn. It is not the same way to ask questions to teachers to obtain specifics answers and explanations. At the same time, the brain need to develop in socialize with people around us. As example, students who cannot speak English very well, it is important to attend classes in school to socialize and speak more for develop language.

Another reason, the education of students can relate with respect to others and show the culture of education that teachers in school gives every day and it is better than distance learning. On the other hand, online benefit some students that missed school as to finish the homework. However, school benefit students to show knowledge at least earn credit in school and obtain the diploma.

At last, some students that cannot attend school because of jobs or other reasons, the schedule in school still help every day. Most for Seniors, this help to continue attend school and have better ways to learn. Schools and teachers are the reasons why children and teenagers learn about life.

227,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is the closest planet to Earth In the terms of the density and size, and on distance too, but each previos mission was unmanned, no spcaecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. It's been three decades since a spaceship has touched down on Venus, Is a challenging planet for the humans to study even despite of the proximity to us. Also, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets on Venus, but what's more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the Venus atmosphere.

The temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what is on planet Earth, the conditions are far more extreme than anything we humans encounter on Earth. Even if Mercury is closer to the sun, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet on the solar sytem and it also presents additional impedimentslike powerful earthquakes, erupting volcanoes.

If the scientists know everything about this why are they discussing about visiting Venus if it isn't a good place where we humans could be and live at, because we wouldn't even be able to live for a day just as the spacecraft that didn't even survided just only for a few hours.

It's better to keep studying Venus then to just go visit it, because there would probably be stuff on Venus that the scientist don't even know about and then the people that would go visit Venus would be in such danger. In conlusion, scientist should still be doing research about Venus, because everything they have known recently about Venus it sounds really dangerous just to go and see it on their own then they would put their lifes in danger, and I don't think that's what they want so It's better to keep doing more research about it instead of just going without knowing everything about the planet.",9bZWAhMiuXA6FtwF9J2N,GPT4o,ms,Literary,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

230,"Summer projects have been a task asked of students since the beginning of school. There is an ongoing debate about whether summer projects should be issued by teachers or if students should be the ones to design the project. Those who oppose this state that students designing the project would make it easier and more fun but this is not the case. Although some may disagree, projects issued out by teachers would be very beneficial.

Summer projects designed by teachers will erase a huge struggle in students summer projects. Since students already know the topic it will be easier to complete. Meaning students will be able to complete the projects in less time with better results. Students have been learning the curriculum the whole year and teachers will base the project off of the same curriculum. Students will also have a clear rubric to follow for the project. This will make it less stressful for students since teachers will include a rubric on what has to be on the project. Since all of the projects will be the same students can work together. This is beneficial so students can complete the task faster and revise with their peers, leading to students having overall better projects and better grades.

In addition, teacher designed projects will help students in the upcoming year. Teachers will be using the same curriculum. This ensures that students are learning things that will benefit them in the future. Instead of just being busy work to ruin their summers. Teacher designed projects will be helpful for the next year as well. Since the student will be doing this project during the summer they will retain the information for the next school year. Teacher created projects will also give students a head start in the class. Since students will already know the basics of what they will be learning. Resulting in less students being behind and more time to focus on learning.

Although some may disagree, projects issued out by teachers would be very beneficial. This is the case due to projects being helpful for the next year, learning the correct curriculum, and giving you a head start in the class. Those who oppose this state students will be more obligated to complete a task they designed and students will have more fun if they created it, but this is not true. Teacher created prompts will be very helpful in aiding students during gruesome summer projects.",GPT4o,oKWdZB7QXEMEDgJvudU1,hs,Persuasive,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Take a position on this question. Support your response with reasons and specific examples.,8,teacher-AI
231,"Summer projects should be student-designed as long as the teacher is still in control of the overall process. This system engages the students more, while also ensuring that they continue to learn over the break.

As a rule, students are more likely to complete an assignment and enjoy doing so if they have control over the parameters of the assignment. If a student is interested in a certain field of study, they should be able to freely explore and learn about it. Designing their own assignment would allow them to do this. For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.

However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will ""slack off"" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of ""what is the effect of temperature on ice?"" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome.

In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too ""obvious"" or easy.

Although student-designed projects can go awry, they can also be very successful if they are created with the guidance of a teacher. Students should be given every opportunity to learn on their own and explore their individual passions.       ",A1568InefhqsFCQNF83n,GPT4o,hs,Persuasive,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

232,"Summer projects, even though most kids disagree with these being assigned in the summer, are a great way to make sure kids keep being productive and expanding their knowledge throughout the summer. That makes them very important since most kids detach themselves from school related activities in the summer and making students have a project done by the beginning of the school year, will make sure they are ready to come to school, be productive, and learn. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will make the student have more fun and expand their creativity while also assuring the best results.

Summer is about being able to do whatever and have fun. While some students believe that big summer projects could take away from the fun, making them student- designed will ensure that students make them based on things that they enjoy. Also, having students design their projects will make them really think and be creative. When grading these projects, teachers should partially grade them off of creativity. These types of projects can be truly amazing because they can show how creative kids can be when given time and a choice and show what great things they are capable of.

Kids always do better when they are inspired and have the choice to do things their way. People are able to show their best when they are inspired and enjoy what they are doing. A great example of this can be seen in the workplace in the way that people that don't enjoy what they do for a living do not normally give the best results. This always applies to every one.

Even though student-designed projects are great, teacher-designed projects are more predictable and easier to grade. If teachers design the projects, then most students will do similar things unlike with student-designed projects. If every student does something different, then the grading system for them will be a lot more complex making it a lot more difficult on the teachers.

Although student-designed projects are unpredictable and more diverse. They promote all the good things about learning and make sure that they are making the best out of their summers. The positives completely outweigh the negatives since you are able to see the great potential all kids contain if they work on things that they are passionate about.         ",GPT4o,eL9OUf6tZMPuCTxO5H8E,hs,Persuasive,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

235,"The Face on Mars is a mystery of how it was created. Know one knows how it was made, if it was created by aliens or just a natural landform. People may think that since it is in space it has to do with aliens in some possible way. Scientist Jim Garvin discovered a landform similar to the Face on Mars. The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the shape of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. They also have discovered that the surveyor has labeled it a natural landform. The Face on Mars is catergorized as a mesa which is around the American West. Could the Face on Mars be a natural landform?

The similar land form in Idaho has the same height as the Face on Mars. The pictures that they have captured shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. If this was a alien type of act the MGS would have seen the alien's shelters, airplanes, and pyramids. The Face on Mars is not a alien' s sculpture. NASA's surveyor had labeled the face as a natural landform. The surveyor catergorized it as a natural landform because it didn't pick up any traces of alien activity. Also, if NASA wasn't forsure about their discovery they woudn't have posted it on websites or annonced it to the world. They said that they would have rathered kept this information classified. Why would you put a false statement on the internet, expecially if it involved aliens, because then the world would be going crazy. They would be preparing for them to attack and abduct people.

I could understand why some people could believe that aliens made up this rock like object. One of the most obvious reasons is that it is space. On the day when they wanted to take another picture it was very cloudy and you couldn't see the face, which some believe that aliens had hid the face by a haze.

The authors said it was a huge rock formation that resembled a human head. They also mentioned that the shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. It was believed to be just another rock.

Since the story, the ""Face on Mars"" starred in films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows.

I believe this software can be very helpful to people in many different fields: in an office, at a restaurant, and especially in classrooms.

This new technology can be a very helpful tool in teaching all different types of students at their pace instead of teaching a specific groap of kids at one pace. In a classroom, it can be very intimidating and nerve recking to raise your hand and be the only one with a question.

Though the author also states that some of these methods can be costly and impratical. I think that driverless cars should not be developed further. For the reason that it would be much safer with drivers and we do not need to change much then.

With a driver behind the wheel, the driver would be much more effective at keeping themself safe. The driver can see the oncoming cars, traffic, or construction and avoid them. The driverless car could possibly not be aware of some of these conditions and then wreck the car. The sensors on the driverless car could also malfunction while driving and result in the same effect. The driver could just work around all of it and not have to rely on their car to keep them safe. The author even states that right now these situations require human skill rather than the car doing it all.

If we were to have these driverless cars, we might have to change the roads to allow these to work. Changing all the roads to work with these cars would be very costly and take quite a while to finish. We also have to worry about putting new laws into place about safety. Like the author says, if someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer. Would the driver be at fault because they were in the car, or would the manufacturer be at fault because the car's technology failed?

To conclude, the driverless cars should not be further developed. They could potentially put a person in danger, they would not be very cost effective, and a lot would need to be changed.

This shows the readers that Venus is worth studying because there may have been life on this planet. Therefore, NASA needs to send researchers to Venus to identify if there is life or not. The author gives another example by referencing Earth-like features to show that thesremay be some form of life or a way of nature, these references include Venus having mountains, valleys, and craters. This validates the authors point well.

The author also gives ideas on how to help make a possible trip to Venus easier and less dangerous. They talk about using a bump-like vehicle that orbits or hovers about 30 miles above the surface. This vehicle has benefits, and also gives disclaimers. Some benefits would include astronauts being able to explore the land easier, avoiding the ""unfriendly"" ground, and keeping good air pressure. the text states ""however, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safey far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, redndering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This shows as a disclaimer to give unbiased proof ofnegative effects.

This article is full of evidence to support the authors idea of studying Venus.

245,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers it presents, because no spacecraft has survied landing for more than a few hpurs sice it too hot for the spacraft. Venus is not really close to the sun ans still have extreme heat but its closer to the Earth which often referred to as the Earth's ""twin."" It's more challenging because in Paragraph 3 its says,"" On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" the conditions are too extreme for a human for a human to set foot on Venus.

NASA is sending humans to study Venus to figure out what kinds of material they need to send a spacecraft to Venus and explore it. In Paragraph 5 its says, ""NASA's possible soultion to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" Venus has almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide which is not good for human, so they would need much more material for the human to survive with all that carbon dioxide. Scientists are seeking to condut a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk (Paragraph 6).

NASA is working on studying more about Venus, but it's still risky for humans and spacecraft. NASA is now testing simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested on Venus's surface and has lasted about 3 weeks in such condition. In such heat the material should be liquefy because of extreme heat. It won't be easy but NASA is trying to make it survivalbe for humans.

246,"The author uses many details from the article to support his claim that Venus is worthy pursuit desipte the dangers it presents by telling the reader how dangerous Venes is. For example the author tells us about some details about the temperatures, like how it would be around 170 fahenheit there. The air pressure would be close to sea level on earth. These details he gives us about the conditions Venus has are far to exterme, but the author says it survivable for humans.

A second, detail that the author gives use is about NASA trying to collect samples of rocks so they can study. But most of the robots they send to Venus get destroyed because of the choas that happens there. Another project that they did was that they used technology called mechanical computers. These mechanical conputers are are powerful, flexible, and quick but the are delicate when it comes to extreme conditions.

A third detial, that the author gave us information about the text was that not even a single space ship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. The author also goes on to say how the more challenging the place is the more they examine more closely. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. The Earth and Venus aslo orbits the sun in different times so its harder to vist it.

Venus is sometimes the Evening Star due to the fact that it is the brightest light in the sky also making it simple for amateur stargazer to spot. Now scientist say that it may be possible to live on Venus some day but they are having a hard time trying to study Venus because of a thick atomosphere that almost has 97 percent carbon dioxide.

Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in terms of density and size. One of the National Aeronautics an Space Administration are trying to send humans to study Venus.

250,"The driverless cars has been an idea that has been around for many years. The thought of not having to waste energy in driving and to make the experience more relaxing for the individual. It will also display the amount of intellegence and engineering it would take in order to construct such a car. However, there will be many different people who will wish to insult and bring down the idea of the driverless cars. Not only that, but there will people in the world who would wish to turn the positive idea into a negative one. It will also start to corrupt our natural human abilities. What I mean by that is humans will start to become more and more relient on having everything completed for them with minimal effort envolved. Eventually, we will start to become lazier and lazier as advancements in technology increases. One thing to note, I am not entirely against automation or self-seficient machinery. However, how could we say that we are hard working individuals when a robot will be doing the work for us? Could we truely call ourselves hard working when all we would have to do is push a button?

One major example of how this will be a problem in the future is the fact that there won't be any laws inplace of the driverless cars. Numerous states have already opposed the idea and plan to keep it that way until the cars are proven reliable. In paragraph 9, it also discusses who will be counted liable for an accident. ""...if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?""(Waiting)

However, when its another world, its a completely different story? No. Mars is a desert, and why cant formations like this be found there? The truth is they can.

265,"The thought of having driverless cars being introduced in the near future is for one, scary and exciting. There are two ways that you can come about the driverless cars, you can enjoy and agree with the idea or you can disagree.

Google has been working on this project since 2009, they have built cars that can drive more than half a million miles without crashing. The cars arent's 100% percent driverless. Yes, the cars will be able to drive for you, but only for a certain amount of time. People think that since they're driving driverless cars, that they can text, be on their phones, or do whatever while in the car. The cars cannot deal to drive around roadwork or accidents, drive in traffic issues, or pull in and out of driveways. That's when you have to take control of the car, and drive yourself. So, the drivers have to be alert and ready to take the wheel when the time comes. GM has came up with the idea that the driver's seat will vibrate when the vehicle is in danger and needs assistant. Google's vehicles announce the driver when the driver should prepare to take over the wheel. They are improving more and more each day. Telsa has a project in 2016 that releases cars to be able to be on autopilot 90 percent of the time. ""Mercedes-Benz,Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.""

I am not against the idea of having driverless cars. I honestly think it would be a great idea. Airplanes have autopilot, why can't vehicles also. Drivers also have to be real responsible while in driverless cars, they need to keep their eyes on the road at all time and hands on the wheels.

Even you do similar things to this software, for example; you might be able to guess the emotion of someon based on their face expresion, right? This software works the same way but in a more accurate level.

This technology would benefit classrooms the most, for example; if the software detects a sad emotion ond the user when learning the software could make the lessong more intersting and making the student stay on track with others.

FACS could also alert teachers of students that could be having problems outside of school based on their emotions. This software can detect ""diferent types of emotions"" like happines, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnes as Dr. Eckman stated.

268,"The use of technology can be operated for many different reasons. Is technology valuable for emotional expressions of students in a classroom?

Everyone has their own opinion in the use of technology based on facial expressions. In my opinion, I believe reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

According to the passage, the computer process begins using a 3-D computer model of the face. The appromixate number of 44 muscles must move just like a human. A man, Dr. Paul Eckman created six different emotions such as, happy, surprised, angry, sad, fear, and disgust. Then each characteristic would be assocaiated by the moventment of the facial muscles.

This technology can be helpful for students because of new emotion-recognized software tracks these facial movements. By weighting the different units, the software can identified by the using mixed emotions. Each emotion is compared against neutral face, in other words no expression shown. You can tell the difference of a person's face of how they're feeling just by looking at their face. But they might alsp, have other feelings within inside them.

269,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System sounds like an excellent idea. It would allow schools to make classes more enjoyable for students. Teachers would know if the students are understanding the lessons. Teachers could know if students are stressing and help them calm down. The software would help provide better data for researchers. The program would benefit both students and teachers. It would also make getting data for research easier.

With the use of the new software, schools can provide a better learning environment. The program can tell people how the students respond to lessons and how they are taught. Teachers can take this information and use it to better their classrooms. They can make their lessons more interactive and fun. The software would allow for more labs to be performed in science classes. It might inspire students to go into science fields if they enjoy the F.A.C.S.

The technology could help teachers recognize struggling students. Many students will not say that they need help, even if they do. Teachers may be able to help brighten a student's day, so they do not spend the rest being sad. This could help prevent school ""accidents"" and keep the school's environment ""happier."" The F.A.C.S could help teachers know when the students need a minute's break to help them refocus.

The software could help researchers collect better data faster. Researchers would not need to go to schools to collect information. They could just take it from the program directly. This could help them improve the technology and make it more efficient. The information would help in other studies regarding schools or students. It could also alert people to dangers in the classrooms by detecting whenever students are scared.

People often get distracted when driving. Whether, it's a mother trying to help her child, a teenager recieving a text, or a person is fatigue. People can only focus on so many things before something goes wrong. The driverless car would be focusing on the road no matter what. This way, the ""driver"" doesn't have to worry when looking away for a spilt second. Some people don't have fast reflexes, and can't brake on time, the senors could help with all this.

The driverless car can help with people who cannot drive, like the elderly. An elderly person cannot drive themselves around when nobody else can. WIth this car, it can solve that for them. With the elderly in this car that can drive itself, instead of the elderly person driving, it would be safer for the elder person and other people on the road. The elder wouldn't have to worry about not being able to look at the signs or farway objects anymore, since the car will be in control.

I do understand that something could go wrong with the car when in use. I beileve that there should be some sort of precautions set, in cause of faulty of product. Who would be the one to blame? It should all depend on evdience. If it was built wrong, then the manufacturer. If the person in the car knew something was wrong, and decided not to get it fix, the person is at fault for not fixing the problem before anything happened.

I beileve that driverless cars should be produce. I feel that it could change everything for the better. It could make life more simple, and easy. It could decrease car accidents. No more worrying about taking every turn you take is a bad one. You wouldn't have to worry if you're not quick enough to stop.

278,"To me I like the idea of having driverless cars, because if someone goes on a long vacation and they did not want to fly they would have to drive. When you are driving for a long period of time your legs will eventually get tired and you will have to stop at rest station. With the driverless cars they will drive themselves and you can just sit back and relax while of course still paying attention to the road ahead of you. This will get you to your destination in less time because you will make less stops.

In the article is states, ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant. The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This is a good thing for these types of cars because you do not want your car to just go straight through a construction zone and not be able to stop it. Or you do not want your car to go the wrong way if there is a detour. I like the idea on how if the driver needed to he can take over the wheel and get going the correct way.

I agree that these cars could be a good thing for us in the future because of the things that I have said above. These cars may not have sounded like a good thing in the beginning but as of right now they are an up and coming thing for us.

I believe the better of the two choices is policy one. I think students should have the opportunity to at least to be able to have a cell phone during a school's provided free time. It would make a lot of more people more prone to like going to their school better anyways, because they don't feel imprisoned within the school walls, like another school could make you feel like but if it were to happen in most schools some kids would take it as an excuse to use their phones during class. But if they were put on a trial period they could see who the more responsible kids with their phones are and make some sort of requirement to be able to use their phone in free time at all. Because some people don't have to work for anything and they just get it handed to them rather it would be by a rich parent or grandparent there comes a point where the hard working people should get rewarded.

Policy 1 states that cell phones are ok during lunch and other free times but must be turned off during class time. I think I can speak for our entire school that, that is the way to go. For these reasons.

Firstly, everyone uses phones anyway and get in trouble so if it's ok then a lot more kids won't get in trouble. Meaning it won't affect there school record. Meaning they can better there education. Meaning they can design a new alternative fuel. Meaning they can change the world and it's thanks to passing this new policy.

Next, is kids want feel like there free. Look, we kids don't have many rights as it is. Our schedule is Wake up, School, homework, bed. I mean come on that's messed up. We can't access the creative side of our minds if we can't play on our phones.

Lastly , I just plainly think no phone policy is stupid. Many kids nowadays have expensive phones and if we can't use it what's the point. Most of our parents gave us the phone in order to call them if we run into trouble so if there's a fight or something going down and we don't want in then we call someone to pick us up. It's that simple.

I hope you can understand my reasoning. We the Kids of the nation deserve at least one right and that right is to enable us to use our phones.

The author also decribes that Venus could sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. The author uses examples of technology that could help us research more about Venus, such as NASA's blimp-like vehicle which could allow scientists to float above the carbon dioxide littered atmosphere, but most of his points about technology wouldn't work because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, which would make most forms of photographs and videos ineffective.

The author of this article claims that Venus is worth the cost and risk just to learn more about it but doesn't support his claim well enough to presuade the reader to agree with him. He backs up technology that wouldn't work because of the atmosphere surrounding Venus and doesn't show ways how we can get past the deadly atmosphere without risk. The author doesn't show enough reason that scientist should study Venus besides that it might have closely resembled Earth in the past.",GPT4o,oKWdZB7QXEMEDgJvudU1,hs,Literary,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

291,"Venus's reputation is challenging for humans to study. It's a thick atmospere of close to about 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Venus is even more challenging because ther're clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in there atomospere,on their surface ther're tempature averages at about 800 degrees farenheit. And the atmospheric pressure is about 90 times greater than what our scientist are experincing on our own planet. Venus's conditions are far more extreme than anything we humans encounter on earth.

Venus's weather has additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. An paragraph 6 sentence 1 it says that venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Also an paragraph 7 sentence 2 its says Venus surface have lasted for three weeks in such condition that another project is looking back an to the old technology.

However, peering at Venus on a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

295,"When i heard about driverless cars i was shocked that they really were coming up with such a thing , yeah its cool but at the same time it is extremely dangerous.

As you can see the automobiles are still having to alert the drivers ! How can it be a driverless car an still need assistance to get out of certain situations? I feel they shouldn't be realesed on the car lots, they can put many adults and children at risk.

The pasage states ''wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive."" The main concern is would the driver actually be alerted by the methods they have,when it's their turn to take control of the automobile. Also in the passage it states the car will look for any road trouble but will the car or driver be prepared for any kids darting across streets or any citizens on bikes .

I believe thats another reason why this car should not be realesed is because in the passage it says ''and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.'',''Presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" There are to many flaws in these Driverless cars for them to get on the main roads just yet.

I feel if the public is concered about the safety of themselfes an their loved ones they would want to really postpone this driverless car situation, because a accident can occur in just a blink of an eye, you would basically be putting your life in danger by trusting technology that still has many problems and flaws .

This is why I believe that these Driverless cars should not be realeased .",GPT4o,NZGkJmXqw8DIYmC2WeE6,hs,Literary,"In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

296,"When people first say this ""face"" it was from a picture that the Viking 1 spacecraft took. Additional reasearch and pictures have been done to see if this is actually a face, just a huge rock formation, or an alien monument. It has shown that it is just a huge rock.

I say its only a huge rock because the passage mentions unusual shadows. THese shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth causing it to look like a face. They did not just form any

""face"" that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. So we know now that t was just a huge rock formation with shadows on it. It is not an actual face carved into rock.

The passage mentions that Michel Malin and his MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the same landform only ten times shaper thn the original. When they looked at this picture it revealed a natural landform. So after all this it wasnt an alie monument after all.

Now the image doesnt show a face and its not an alien monument it is a butte or mesa. Those are commo landforms aroung the american west. So we know for sure not that the ""face on mars"" is actually just a landform with a bunch of shadows that give the illusion of a face.

297,"When summer break starts most students only think about the fun they are going to have over those 3 months. They don't think about learning or gaining knowledge over this period of time. In addition, students forget what they have learned over the course of the long school year. A great way for students to learn while on summer break is to be assigned summer projects. These projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year.

Although, students can be creative in making summer projects for themselves, teachers are better equipped for this task. A teacher makes lesson plans all year so students can learn and pass semester exams. Summer projects can be a cool and fun way to learn. For example, students can create a big poster or PowerPoint displaying all of the things they have learned in school that year. If a student were to create a summer project then they might take it easy on themselves instead of doing something challenging. However, a teacher will give their students a challenge so they can think and problem solve.

Each year students learn the same thing that they learned the previous year, however, they build on what they have learned. This is why it's important for students to stimulate their brains over the summer so the information is not lost or forgotten. If teachers assigned projects to students over the summer then they would have information fresh on their brains ready to use next year.

Consequently, summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year.

For example I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a disney magazine and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half naked women on the cover right next to the kids magazines.

A lot of the music today is also sellling sex, violence, and drugs. My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages.

300,"Why Luke Thinks You Should Join The

Program

Luke thinks that you should should prticipate in Seagoing Cowboys program. I mean,why wouldn't he,he had a great time there and he thinks that you would to. Just in case you don't believe me I will provide some details from the story to prove it.

For instance,in the story he even says that he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Now tell me that doesn't sound like he knew it was going to be great experence for him and it could be a great experence for you.

I got the chance to have this experience and it was honestly life changing. You might not want to do it because of being on the ship, but you can still have fun while on the ship. While on board you have a good time to enjoy playing games and doing your hobbies, here are some, table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading, and whittling.

When you're on the ship your demeanor will change right when you see the marvelouse sights. I had the experience of touring the excavated castle in Crete, seeing Europe and China, and marveling at the Panama Canal while on my way to China. As you arrive at where you are going, something to give you reassurance is knowing that you are doing something good. You are helping people rebuild and recover what they had lost. I had the I'm-on-top-of-the-world feeling as soon as I knew I was helping them get back what they had lost, and I think you will too. This chance is big for you.

''Boom!'' You think in your mind as you look back at the distruction from the war and bombs. That melancholy feeling you get as you see all that has went on will change as you think of why you are there, and what you are doing. I know that you should join this program because it is a once-in-a-life-time chance. You will have fun as I did in my exuberant experience in this program.

When you get there you have to give the animals bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. When you see the animals faces your demeanor will change super fast. If you get invited would you still go.

If you went on this trip it would take you about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

303,"Would it not be nice to have car that will drive and navigate itself? Driverless cars are the transportation of the future. In 2009, Google had already created a car that was almost completely independent and, many other companies such as General Motors had created similar cars. These cars have many unknown variables that still need to be worked out but, driverless cars will be a positive change towards the future.

Scientist have been working on creating a driverless car for years. As of 2009, Google created an almost independent car. The car could do almost anything. the downfall was that the car still relied on driver control in situations such as traffic construction zones. These cars have alert systems to alert the driver when human assistance is needed. Therefor these cars are still safe to operate but not completely independant.

The majority of the driverless cars being invented today have a great deal of sensors.

These sensors allow the cars to distinguish thier surroundings, giving the most amount of safety possible. These cars are also more fuel efficient and eco friendly. They will use less fuel and will be equipped with many safety features. These new features allow the car to see 360 degrees around the vehicle and keep the passenger as safe and comfortable as posible.

As of now, many of these cars still need human attention when driving. They are equipped with vibrating seats and sensors on the wheel to monitor that the human is alert. Eventually these cars will be able to navigate through all situations without any human support. This will allow passengers to enjoy the ride and drive longer distances faster. As well as maintaining confidence in thier safety.

These cars will allow passengers to utilize thier time more efficiently by allowing them to use the time they usually spend driving doing something else. People will be in less danger because there will be no room for human error. If all cars were self driven, then the capacity for safety would be maximized and there would be less polution because the cars are more economical, and less wasteful due to the fuel efficiency of the cars.

306,"Would you want somthing that reads your emotions and finds out weather you are happy, sad or depressed. If so read more to find out some more information about this device to see if you would want this at your job or school.

The reason why this can be a major impact in the class room is that it can read your facial expresstions. Teachers can see if students are struggling or if they are goofing off in class. Teachers can use this type of tool in the class roon to see what they can't see from their desk. This device can read six emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also can associate with peoples movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weightign the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpice). Each expresstion is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

We has humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/hers face. Of course, msot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that the facial recognitinal machine works wonderfuly and would be amazing in any class room.

In conclustion, i belive that this device should be in schools all round that United States. My reasoning is when people come in the school that system can do backround checks on parents or adults that come into the buliding. That makes sure they keep the school safe for teachers and students in the process of everyone else in the building at that time.

Why should teens know team work skills because having team work skills will help them in a long way, like an example a football teams, if on one isn't lessening to no one then there team will probably lose every signal game, the reasoning is that, no one has team work skills. How can they learn team work skills, is by teaching them to understanding others and knowing others for who they are as a person because if they don't want to do it, then why should the other person do it, so teach be the one and get to know them.

no way

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with your decision. I think students should not be allowed to do community service because it takes too much time away from us. We get a lot of homework everyday, which takes half of our time away, and almost every week we have two or three tests. We have to study, do homework, and do house chores, which takes the whole time away from us, and now you want us to do community service! We wont have any time to play and we will have to work all the time. I know that community service will benefit us in the future like in high-school, and I also know that studying is important, but not all the time. If we don't play we will look like school zombies, that always studies. That basically wont be considered life, and what life of a child is. I know and I can understand that community service is very important, but children have a busy life. Students always have to focus on studying, and reach up to their parents hope. For example, my parents want me to get 98 or 99% average, and I study day and night to make my parents proud of me, and i actually do get that high percentages, but if i start doing community service my grades will drop because i wont have enough time to study. Community service and studying is not amusing, but they both benefit us. There are many things that are expected from kids, like community service, but the problem is the amount of pressure these days on a student to A' s that test. If we don't get that much homework and tests, then i am ready to do community service. I really hope you can understand our problems, that we don't have a problem performing community service, even if we have to tutor elementary school children or clean up litter.

I do not believe that it is right to restrict what sport a student plays just because there average grade is not a B what if a student is having trouble in class and not understanding the work. making them quit the team will solve nothing just cause more problems.

i think that this policy is not fear to all the people on a school team. A good player that likes the team and wants to be a part of it is taken of just because they do not have a B average. while a player that does not really want to be on the team and does not try his hardest is left on the team just because he qualifies for the grades.

another reason why we should not have computerized cars is computers take up our whole world now already for instance: our credit cars, our taxes, most jobs are using technogly,our cell phones, when we go to colledge, libraries, jobs mostly obtain computers too. so it shows that we cannot have nothing to ourselfs everything is based on technogly, nothing is on hand made or hand worked anymore. so why should we let the govnerment take over our cars as well ? so the computers are going to be rulers of our world forever for everything.? i dont think so.

Because you can try something new and you can pick what you want to do and meet new people and make more friends. You can learn new skills and learn how to cooperate with people. The best choice are sports because they let you push yourself also there fun. If you get super good at the sports you can do it as a job and get a lot of money.

316,"i think that having self driving cars would help alot. there are so many wreacks in the states because some people just dont know how to drive right.

so if we was to invent and sell computerized cars it could stop us from having so many wreaks plus it would also cause us to drive way safer. for instance if your drunk and you have to get home you just sit in the car and it will drive for you since you cant do it yourself because your not in the right stae of mind.

there is also the thought of making better roads but when you think about it that would cost more then a fortune to do. one other reason im all for this invention is because you know that the people making these cars are gonna earn a tone of money so that means more people will be switching to the new car instead of their old one. before you know it there will be somthing new and even better in technology since we just keep getting smarter over the years. who knows we might be driving hover craft later on in a few years because alot can be learned.

although we would also have to make some new laws or change a few of them. like in the text it states that what if somone gets in a wreak in a smart car should the driver be blamed or the companies that sold the the car to that person beheld responcibale. there also still some improvements that have to be made before they can even start selling those cars .

those are the main reasons that i think making smarter cars is a great idea.",GPT4o,m4J0F1dlL5fDySsezOUE,hs,Literary,"In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.
